The collection also contains nine postcards.\n\n Some of the letters convey a good sense of the issues and circumstances which shaped student life at Princeton University during a time of change.\n\n The letters from the academic year of 1903 and 1904 contain the most detail about the relationship between Freshmen and Sophomore students. A letter dated December 4, 1903, reveals some of the ways Sophomores \"horse\" the Freshmen. A discussion of the \"expulsion of students\" resulting from a cheating scandal is discussed in letters of February 6 and 7, 1904. Sophomores \"horsing\" of Freshmen involved a variety of initiation activities. Throwing bags of flour on Freshmen when they were having their class picture taken and being \"ambushed\" by Sophomores with snowballs as they crossed campus are but two of the many \"horsing\" rituals. In his February 10th, 1904 letter John relates how students reacted when they found out Robb and he were twins. The lifting of Freshmen restrictions and the number of \"students flunked\" after mid terms are discussed in a letter of February 21, 1904. A reaction to President Wilson's new policies and the preceptorial system can be seen in letters of May 1, 1904 and February 23 and 28, 1905. There are two letters from friends which are in response to invitations by John and Robb.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","publish":true},{"subnotes":[{"content":"The letters are arranged chronologically.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","type":"arrangement","persistent_id":"041a261baf6aa1cdefe6b0a0babe2ceb","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"e7469b3bf6b51b2cbc9edab126795c26","rights_restriction":{"local_access_restriction_type":[]},"subnotes":[{"content":"Collection is open for research use.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","type":"accessrestrict","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"2edc7383be832c802f0e87107e7bde6c","type":"userestrict","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true,"content":"Single photocopies may be made for research purposes.

The collection contains letters and postcards written while Green was vacationing in Europe in the summer of 1908 with his older brother Joseph Coy Green. He describes his perceptions of and experiences in Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Holland, Belgium, France and England.\n\n The bulk of the letters were written when Green was an undergraduate student at Princeton University. His letters during the autumn of 1908 are significant, as they provide vivid descriptions of initiation traditions consisting of various \"horsing\" activities in which Sophomores challenged the spirit and endurance of the Freshmen class. Green, being of stocky build, was assigned a front row position among the charging Freshmen class in the activities. In the Election Rush, Freshmen students had to fight their way through lines of Sophomores who were blocking the entrance to the gymnasium where Freshmen elections were to be held. The Cannon Rush was a major event in which Freshmen had to break through lines of Sophomores tied together encircling the cannon. The objective of the rush was for the Freshmen to take control of the cannon by knocking off the president of the Sophomore class who stood on top of it swinging a rope in all directions in an attempt to beat back the courageous challengers. The Cane Spree was another favorite challenge where a cane had to be wrestled by a Freshman from the hands of a Sophomore. The only rule that was strictly adhered to in the Election Rush, Canon Rush and Cane Spree was that no biting was allowed. Aside from that anything went. Green's description of the aftermath of rushes is that they \"weld the class together and put some spirit in it\". For example he went on to say \"I am pulling for my class and college now as I never did before.\"\n\n The collection contains a significant number of Princeton University written examinations in the areas of History, English, Economics, Politics and Philosophy. An anthology of Green's poetry published in 1917 by his brother Robert Green and Grace Morgan (Green's fiancee) gives a good sense of a style and theme of poetry being created at Princeton University in the early twentieth century.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"persistent_id":"acd1b2a4105295bc9550ba2b208607bd","type":"scopecontent","publish":true},{"rights_restriction":{"local_access_restriction_type":[]},"persistent_id":"0ea6422386c81a33727eb066c817c9f6","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"content":"Collection is open for research use.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"type":"accessrestrict","publish":true},{"type":"userestrict","persistent_id":"9db3ed04c38e8af50312029f1c1d32ef","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true,"content":"Single photocopies may be made for research purposes.

Although there are company and business letters in nearly all the books, they are comparatively few in number and embody nothing like a history of Thompson's Bancroft Company. Except to a biographer the family and personal letters are of scant interest. From a literary standpoint the letters are totally uninteresting; Thompson was a businessman who said what he had to say directly and in as few words as possible. There is a handwritten list of Princeton-related letters by number for each of the copybooks.\n\n On the loose correspondence (1906-1913): The letters are entirely related to Princeton. Because Thompson chaired the Board of Trustees for a period, and was chairman of the Grounds and Buildings Committee for 20 years, the bulk of them refer to issues related to these offices. A number refer to Curriculum Committee matters, and a few concern personal favors or opinions requested of Thompson as a trustee. Of significant interest are the proposals for alternative dining and housing systems at Princeton (i.e. Quad and Sophomore Commons plans), which involve controversies over the value of the club system and the nature of Princeton undergraduate social life in general. These controversies were part of Wilson's \"academic ideals\" conflict in 1910, which encouraged his decision to resign as president. There are letters from Woodrow Wilson (8), Theodore Roosevelt (2), William Gibbs McAdoo, Edwin Denby and a single letter to Col. E. M.

scrapbook collection consists of scrapbooks maintained by 220 students totaling 296 volumes and documents the social and academic activities of Princeton undergraduates. By their very nature, scrapbooks are idiosyncratic, but generally they contain mementos relating to athletic events (such as tickets, programs, printed cheers, ribbons, and buttons), reunions, or life as a Princeton undergraduate. Items in this last category include senior questionnaires, exam questions, admission materials, posters, ephemera from social organizations and clubs, postcards, flyers, photographs, and letters. Frequently newspaper clippings, orchestra, opera, or play programs and tickets, pressed flowers, or three-dimensional items are found. Some scrapbooks include materials about Princeton University added after the individual graduated.\n\n These scrapbooks, individually and in total, provide insight into undergraduate life at Princeton as they document what students valued enough to preserve. Also, the social history of the college is revealed as mementos of the full range of student life and the importance of athletics, drama, musical groups, journalism, travel, theatre, as well as academics are found. Because of the large number of scrapbooks from the 1870s through 1920, the changing interests and tastes of students over time are revealed.\n\n The condition of the books vary greatly. Notable Princetonians whose scrapbooks are found in this collection include Hobey Baker, Ivy L.

Most of the documents are transcriptions of interviews Heath conducted with the students on a regular basis. The students are coded by number, but Heath provided a list to enable individuals to be identified once the collection is opened in 2035. Heath's work was published in The Reasonable Adventurer (1964), which spawned a follow-up volume comparing the study participants with other members of the class of 1954 as part of the class' 25th reunion activities. Series 1 contains advisee files on each participant, and Series 2 contains materials related to the project such as reports and summarized responses on specific topics, as well as one 25th reunion interview titled \"Soundings.\"\n\n Heath maintained eight folders on each student: three on their freshman year, one on their sophomore year, two on their junior year, and two on their senior year. Exceptions exist when folders are missing, or when students died during the course of the study (as did students number 156 and 181), or dropped out of Princeton (as did students number 103, 249, and 371). The first folder contains information on student grades and extracurricular activities.\n\n Although the bulk of the documents are transcriptions of interviews, there is a variety of other material on the students as well. Because Heath served as their faculty advisor all four years, he kept extensive records of their progress at the university academically, socially, and emotionally. He visited the students' homes and took notes on their family make-up and socio-economic background. A few files contain student personal memorabilia Heath considered of interest, such as drawings, newspaper clippings, and freshman English compositions.\n\n The interviews themselves primarily concern University issues, such as course selection and rooming arrangements. Many of the students discussed deeply personal matters with Heath as well. There are some standard questions Heath asked each student to address at different points, questions relating to their perceptions of ethnic and racial minorities, religion, sexual behavior, women, and the Princeton club system. During November of the academic year 1953-54 Heath gave each student a short test for which they had to produce a drawing and writing sample; he discussed it with them afterwards and the interviews were transcribed.\n\n All the interview sheets have code numbers printed on their upper-right hand corners which correspond to the code numbers of the discs on which the interviews were recorded.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"publish":true},{"persistent_id":"8473b9b01b951038adf846bdb7661915","type":"arrangement","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"content":"The collections is divided into two series:","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"publish":true},{"rights_restriction":{"local_access_restriction_type":["Restricted"]},"persistent_id":"7fe19577327b0eac64833ff5cb744e42","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true,"content":"This collection is closed until January 1, 2035, but may be used by scholars who agree to use it for statistical purposes only."}],"type":"accessrestrict","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"0267d29767192854af4d39f18276b78d","type":"userestrict","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true,"content":"Single photocopies may be made for research purposes.

Prominent on a landscape of political assassinations, civil rights, and the fight for gender equality was the prolonged conflict in Vietnam. Although discontent was growing against the war in Southeast Asia, the largest and most vocal expression against America's involvement was compellingly articulated on college campuses throughout the nation. Author Thomas Powers notes that the war in Vietnam was, for America, \"one of those things that come along once in a generation and call entire societies into question, forcing people to choose between irreconcilables.\" One of those irreconcilables, for the Princeton community of students and faculty, was their exclusion from university decisions that involved everything from university parietals to Princeton's association with the Institute for Defense Analysis (IDA). In response to student demonstrations and faculty protests, Princeton President Robert F. Goheen established the Committee on the Structure of the University to examine Princeton University's governance and explore how it could be more inclusive of the university community in making decisions. The Kelley Committee, as it came to be known, would be responsible for the introduction of perhaps the most sweeping administrative changes in the University's history and establishing the Council of the Princeton University Community (CPUC)."],"type":"abstract","persistent_id":"ef6ab2b9378d94c6f9a455ae0e423da9","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"33ecb79c3eae52bb23b64ae869008fc5","content":["mudd"],"type":"physloc","jsonmodel_type":"note_singlepart","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"853db9aa63bc5d1f811d3047b752ff78","type":"scopecontent","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"content":"Consists primarily of correspondence, memoranda, and reports generated by Stanley Kelley, Chair of the Special Committee on the Structure of the University, also known as the Kelley Committee.

For material that Media Services cannot transfer an appropriate vendor will be contacted but the transfer time required can be as little as several days to as long as several months, with costs of upwards of hundreds of dollars per item required for many of these formats. In a very few instances, the library may already have a dub copy available, saving both time and costs. \n\n  For quotations that are fair use as defined under <extref xlink:href=\"http://copyright.princeton.edu/basics/fair-use\" xlink:type=\"simple\">U.

Starting with the notes on John Witherspoon's lecture on Moral Philosophy in 1772 taken by Thaddeus Dod, Class of 1773, the collection concludes with the 1974 notes of Joel Niemi, Class of 1976, for Professor Robert Bergman's Art and Architecture in Medieval Europe. Some of the lecture notes are very thorough documents while others are brief. Most of the notes are handwritten in lined, bound notebooks or on typical notebook paper. Examples from the early 19th century serve as models of fine penmanship and often include ink drawings and even watercolors to illustrate such things as scientific apparatus (see Frederick Giger's notes for Joseph Henry's Natural Philosophy in 1840) or the Greek classical orders (see Charles Shield's notes for Albert Dod's Architecture in 1842). Certain courses were highly valued as evidenced by their frequent appearance in this collection. Researchers can track their evolution over an extended period. Specific examples include Joseph Henry's Natural Philosophy, with notes from 1835 to 1857, James McCosh's Psychology, with notes from 1869 to 1881, and Albert Friend's Northern Renaissance, with notes from 1939 to 1950. The advances in learning are also reflected in the courses offered over time. Courses in the 20th century with defined subjects such as mathematics and physics fell under the rubric of Natural Philosophy during the 19th century. Generalized history and literature courses become specialized as in Professor Eric Goldman's History of American Liberalism or Professor Carlos Baker's Romantic Movement in English Literature.\n\n Aside from five university presidents (Hibben, Maclean, McCosh, Smith, and Wilson), there are numerous famous faculty represented in the collection, including Stephen Alexander, Lyman Atwater, Carlos Baker, Cyril Black, Cyrus Fogg Brackett, Hadley Cantril, John Duffield, Donald Egbert, Frank Fetter, Arnold Guyot, Walter \"Buzzer\" Hall, Joseph Henry, Edwin Kemmerer, Charles Rufus Morey, Erwin Panofsky, and Thomas Jefferson Wertenbaker. Some well-known students include John Maclean, William Magie, John Duffield, and John Hibben. The collection includes only one woman's lecture notes, those of Louisa B. Maclean, niece of President Maclean, who sat in on James Murray's English Literature in 1878.","publish":true}],"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","type":"scopecontent","persistent_id":"1dd978b03d6c20584e4400c884362020","publish":true},{"rights_restriction":{"local_access_restriction_type":[]},"persistent_id":"cd075190f46cb212d9044f1d14476f60","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true,"content":"Collection is open for research use."}],"type":"accessrestrict","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"b42a945b683a4f84276decfd4deb182f","type":"userestrict","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true,"content":"Single photocopies may be made for research purposes.

This songbook is the single largest compilation of Princeton songs sung by students and alumni over the years and was frequently updated and revised.\n\n Other songbooks include a series of Campus/Class booklets roughly 3\" x 2\" in size with some variations. Students have used these for senior step-singing and at annual reunions. The time frame covered is 1854 to 1982, and all contain traditional songs such as \"Old Nassau,\" along with several popular songs from each year and at times the class song.\n\n There are also a number of special editions of \"Old Nassau\" containing several arrangements of the song, as well as an autobiography by the composer Karl Langlotz and a biography of the lyricist Harlan P. Peck printed between 1905 and 1906. The presentation edition was autographed by Langlotz.\n\n In addition to a number of miscellaneous songbooks and songs with Princeton as their theme, the Princeton Music Collection includes five collegiate songbooks immortalizing a variety of colleges.\n\n The final component of the collection is a series of sheet music consisting for the most part of spirit, football, and reunion songs. The sheet music includes autographed pieces by alumnus Kenneth S. Clark, Class of 1907 (\"What Do We Want? Touchdown\" and \"Princeton Forward March\"), J. F. Hewitt, Class of 1907 (\"Come, Ye Men of Princeton\"), Arthur H. Osborn, Class of 1907 (\"The Princeton Cannon Song\"), and Harold Nason, Class of 1898 (\"Orange and Black March\").

In addition, there are 38 amateur prints taken in March through May 1905 depicting the land before any construction work commenced, and two photograph albums containing construction images.\n\n It is not known who took the photographs that document the construction of Lake Carnegie, but there are several possibilities, and because there appears to be more than one negative numbering system there may have been more than one photographer. The engineer of the lake project would have overseen the taking of photographs, and upon the death of J. J. R. Croes a great deal of photographic equipment and supplies were inventoried in his office. However, it is unlikely that Croes took the photographs himself; as engineer of the entire Lake Carnegie project he would probably have hired a photographer. F. P. Gridley, who worked as foreman and timekeeper of the lake project, owned copyright of the photographic souvenir booklet published for the lake's opening celebrations (1906), but Gridley is never mentioned in the records of the lake project as the photographer. James M. McKenzie writes to Alexander Gulick that he was making a complete photographic record of the work done on the lake, but because McKenzie also writes to Gulick of \"the photographer\" or \"his photographer\" at various points, it does not seem likely that McKenzie took these photographs. At the end of December 1906 McKenzie wrote to Gulick that a photographer by the name of Hazard was going to come to take photographs of the lake. This must refer to E. W. Hazard, and there is one photograph taken by E. W. Hazard of the Delaware &amp; Raritan Canal in the Historical Photograph Collection - Grounds and Buildings Series - Lake Carnegie. Hazard may have taken some of the construction photographs, although he did not sign any of the negatives or prints found in the negative boxes as he did the photograph of the Canal.\n\n As mentioned above, there appears to be more than one system of numbering the Lake Carnegie glass plate negatives. In some instances there are duplicate negative numbers, and some negatives have what appears to be a date indicated on the negatives. For example, a negative in the box identified as \"Washington Street July\" is labeled \"864 7/3.\" This may indicate that the photograph was taken on July 3, but this is not certain and should not be taken at face value.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true}],"persistent_id":"94bd9707b6cdf5c1282dab4a5dca62af","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","publish":true},{"rights_restriction":{"local_access_restriction_type":[]},"type":"accessrestrict","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The glass plate negatives have been rehoused and retired from use.

Mudd Manuscript Library holds a wide range of audiovisual media within its collections, many of which are obsolete or on fragile media or both.

Mudd’s policy requires that originals be dubbed to a digital medium, checked for copyright at that point a reference copy may be provided to researchers. All costs of transferring are borne by the researcher. Princeton University’s Media Services handles most of our digitization for audiovisual materials, which is processed by Mudd Library staff. Media Services may require up to 6 weeks to complete a request and this does not include the 1-2 days that Mudd Library staff require to locate, deliver, retrieve, and send requests. For material that Media Services cannot transfer an appropriate vendor will be contacted but the transfer time required can be as little as several days to as long as several months, with costs of upwards of hundreds of dollars per item required for many of these formats. In a very few instances, the library may already have a dub copy available, saving both time and costs.\n\n For quotations that are fair use as defined under U. S.

It is worn with some damage to the spine and front cover. However, its sixty-five pages are intact.\n\n The inside front cover has the inscriptions \"Wm Woodhull Book, 1760\" and \"Wm Woodhull's Book, 1766\" as well as \"January 1760\\S.H.Rose\\This Book belongs to Wm. Woodhull.\" The back cover has the inscription \"David Platt\\Me polsidet\\Name\\William Woodhull.\" David Platt, who died in 1768, was a classmate of Woodhull's. S.H. Rose was not a Princeton alumnus.\n\n The volume's entries range from 1763-1850, but most are undated. It would appear that most of the entries are by Woodhull but since some are dated after his death in 1824 someone else continued to use the book.\n\n The contents of the notebook can be divided into four general groups:\n\n 1) Daily catechism to 25 questions of a religious nature (dated from December 4, 1763 to July 29, 1764). Examples are: \"What works of Necessity and Mercy may be done on the Sabbath?\" and \"In what sense can we love our neighbor as ourselves?\" This section comprises approximately one-fourth of the book.\n\n 2) Two orations. \"On the Creation\" (January 15, 1764) and \"On Death\" (undated) written as part of graduation exercises. Each oration is 6-7 pages in length.\n\n 3) Recipes and prescriptions for various illness and afflictions. There are approximately 100 such recipes and together they comprise one-half of the book. Some examples are \"To cure the cholera,\" \"Cure of Mal de Franse; or the Clap,\" and \"Rheumatick Ointment.\"\n\n The recipes appear to have been entered in two groups. The first, approximately two-thirds of the total, consists of little more than lists of ingredients. They are separated by carefully drawn lines with two or three recipes per page. This group was apparently written during Woodhull's college days as one of the last entries is dated \"July 10 [17]66.\"\n\n The second group of recipes consists of more extensive entries many dealing with dosages and treatment. They are entered somewhat more haphazardly than the first group. They also extend over a longer period of time with the earliest date being 1802 and the latest 1850, indicating that some were entered by someone other than Woodhull. This group also gives the source for some of the recipes, e.g. \"Taken from the National Advocate of June 27th, 1823.\"\n\n 4) A poem (undated) of four pages entitled \"A Dialogue between the fallen Angels and a human Spirit just entered into the other worlds...\" and extracts (undated) from \"Sherloe on Death\", \"Cato's letters, \" and an extract from a sermon by Joshua Huntington delivered in 1816.\n\n (There are also two brief descriptions of the weather in Morris County, dated April 14 and May 24, 1832.)\n\n It would appear that Woodhull used his book for a variety of purposes. After listing some medicinal recipes, he began his daily catechism. After the last catechism and a few blank pages, he began his two orations. Blank pages follow, then the rest of the recipes.\n\n Woodhull arranged his poems and extracts starting from the back of the book. Blank pages between sections would indicate that he intended to partition his book for different purposes.\n\n Little if any insight to the daily life and regimen of the mid-18th century Princeton student can be gained from this book. However, the daily catechism and orations do give an idea of the curriculum at that time. Of more interest to the history of 18th century medicine and pharmacy may be the many recipes and prescriptions."}],"publish":true},{"type":"accessrestrict","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true,"content":"Collection is open for research use."}],"rights_restriction":{"local_access_restriction_type":[]},"persistent_id":"9e9427e3a800c4d15dba18bb4d8db094","publish":true},{"subnotes":[{"content":"Single photocopies may be made for research purposes.

From discussion panels that examined the impact of coeducation to the printing of posters commemorating the event to funds that would support speakers, these proposals offer an exceptional perspective on how the concerns of the Princeton were not just concerns of a university community, but concerns of society as a whole.\n\n Included in the collection is the final report to President Harold Shapiro by the Steering Committee. Joan Girgus, in her final letter to the President, noted that \"the report . . . can serve both as a narrative description of the 20th Anniversary commemoration and as an archival compendium of the events and activities that occurred during the 18 months\" of the commemorative period.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"type":"scopecontent","publish":true},{"type":"arrangement","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"content":"The folders in this collection have been arranged in alphabetical order by form or topic, with their contents in chronological order.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","persistent_id":"b255d55b106c933f1041d366886cb99a","publish":true},{"subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"Collection is open for research use."}],"type":"accessrestrict","persistent_id":"595f465bb99a2302846fb23f41d2ed65","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","rights_restriction":{"local_access_restriction_type":[]},"publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","persistent_id":"927b654d59afacf29cc6020ff4ca5905","subnotes":[{"content":"Single photocopies may be made for research purposes.

Additionally, there are photographs which include portraits of Rauch and his family, Princeton era snapshots, and about a dozen photographs of Operation Crossroads atomic blasts. A significant amount of the work described in the letters relates to radio telemetry, about which Rauch co-wrote a book with Dr. Myron Nichols. There is also a group of Princeton-related ephemera including course notes for a class Rauch taught and other academic items.\n\n In the correspondence, which forms the bulk of the collection, Rauch describes his academic and social life at Princeton to his family, and includes details on his World War II defense work. From the beginning of his time at Princeton, Rauch was passionate about his studies in mathematics and physics. This work had the added benefit of providing deferral from the military draft. His letters include copious details regarding his academic work, social life, living quarters, eating situation, interest in radio telemetry, and war-time jobs.\n\n In the 1941 letters, Rauch describes attending seminars given by Professor Einstein, a growing relationship with Dean Eisenhart and the Eisenhart family, as well as \"secret defense work\" that he promptly becomes involved in. A description of exams, type of work, and types of courses are a quotidian part of the letters. Not only does Rauch consistently mention his heavy course load at Princeton, he also talks about traveling throughout the east coast for defense work. Of special note are trips to Hotel Niagara and the Pentagon, and he also traveled to New York, Vermont and North Carolina. He frequently admonishes his parents that the work is \"top secret\" and must not be discussed with anyone.\n\n His mentorship under Professor Tukey increases during these years and their friendship progresses as well. Effects of the war present themselves in the letters: rationing, friends leaving to fight, a Japanese Princeton professor forced to repatriate after Pearl Harbor. The correspondence covers several historically important events to both the country and the University such as Pearl Harbor, military in residence on the Princeton campus, and the fire in the University Gym.\n\n Until 1943, Rauch wrote home nearly every Sunday. Rauch tells his parents about his social activities, including frequent teas with other students and faculty at Dean Eisenhart’s, beer parties with other students, learning ping pong, dates with the Dean’s daughter Anna Eisenhart, going to picture shows, and more. There is a lacuna in the letters from the time he started dating his first wife, Yvonne, until he married her (July of 1943 to January of 1944). After his marriage, the letters were more sporadic.\n\n A significant amount of the work described in the letters relates to radio telemetry, about which Rauch co-wrote a book with Dr. Myron Nichols. His work on \"secret defense projects\" during the war involved radio telemetry, as did his work on Operation Crossroads after the war."}],"persistent_id":"84164f8e22eccf2a66dff6571229154d","type":"scopecontent","publish":true},{"type":"accessrestrict","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"content":"The collection is open for research.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","rights_restriction":{"local_access_restriction_type":[]},"persistent_id":"92c3c39579080a88fec52ddfcbabfde8","publish":true},{"subnotes":[{"publish":true,"content":"Single photocopies may be made for research purposes.

Princeton students were taking and possibly developing their own photographs on campus as early as the 1870s and early 1880s, perhaps in the darkrooms in the John C. Green School of Science.\n\n The photographs in the Student Photographers Series comprise what must be a small proportion of the photographs taken by Princeton students in the late nineteenth century. The majority of photographs are candid shots of fellow students, campus events, and buildings, as well as some shots of the town of Princeton. While most of the candid photographs were taken outside, some were taken indoors. There are a number of photographs, for example, of students in their dormitory rooms. In addition to these candid shots, student photographers captured images of athletic events and various campus activities such as snowball fights and digging out the \"Dinky\" during the \"Blizzard of 1888.\"\n\n A definitive attribution of many of these images is extremely difficult. An individual's name can be found on the back of many of the images in the Student Photographers Series, thus allowing a tentative designation. It is difficult, however, to determine whether the named person is the photographer, the creator of the negative and print, or simply the owner of the print. It appears that Princeton students, some of whom were members of student-formed photography clubs, exchanged negatives with their fellow students or gave photographic prints as gifts. The four students to whom photographs in this collection can be linked (though not in a precise capacity) are: William Winfield Casselberry, Erskine Hewitt, Charles Fisk Howell, and Arthur Garfield Moses. Miss Margareta Paxton donated a group of four images in 1933. She could be related to Harmar Denny Paxton (1891) or William Miller Paxton Jr. (1889).\n\n In addition, a number of duplicate images exist with the names of different individuals written on the back. For example, images numbered 045 and 076 are duplicate photographs of Edgar A. Poe (1891), though one print was made with the negative flipped. Poe posed for the photographer on the athletic field wearing street clothing and leaning on a cane. Image 045 was \"presented by Miss Margareta Paxton, August 1933\" and image 076 was \"presented by Erskine Hewitt, September 16, 1925.\" There is no indication as to whom the images were presented. The images were presented eight years apart,. Similarly, images numbered 010 and 035 are duplicate images of two students posing in the E. M. Museum of Geology and Archaeology. One is attributed to Arthur Moses, the other to no one. Yet another example is a mass snowball fight for which there exist six images: one image is attributed to Arthur Moses, another to Erskine Hewitt, and the rest are unattributed.\n\n Photographs of fellow students, alone and in groups, as well as campus and athletic activities are common in this collection. Baseball is especially well represented, with images of games held on the athletic fields and student-organized games played near Witherspoon Hall. Also present in the collection are images of football and cricket games. Other events represented by multiple images include mass snowball fights and the \"Blizzard of 1888.\" The majority of candids involve groups of students. Individuals appearing in the photographs are generally identified; occasionally owners or creators gave captions to their images. When all the individuals in a group are from the same class, the note will say \"Class of 1891.\" In cases where one individual is not from the class indicated for the group, that individual will have his class year indicated after his name.\n\n These photographs, as part of the larger Historical Photograph Collection, are identified using the same keywords as the Grounds &amp; Buildings Series and Campus Life Series. This was done to facilitate searches of the entire collection using the online database. Images in this series duplicate some of the individuals and subjects found in the other series as well as in the student photograph albums. Additionally, some photographers, such as Erskine Hewitt, created images found in other series of the HPC.","publish":true}],"publish":true},{"persistent_id":"384d6f2dc952867e6ce396acda143e7c","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"content":"This is an unprocessed collection and remains in its original arrangement.\n\n The photographs are organized by the individual, if known, to whom they are attributed.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"type":"arrangement","publish":true},{"rights_restriction":{"local_access_restriction_type":[]},"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","persistent_id":"d38f34b59eb18b13e7a8874fcbe1397c","type":"accessrestrict","subnotes":[{"content":"Collection is open for research use.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true}],"publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","persistent_id":"64650875932c4025ca5899e944ff24eb","type":"userestrict","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"Single photocopies may be made for research purposes.

Included in the minutes is the scheduling of six public meetings covering three broad topics: undergraduate education at Princeton: achievements, problems and prospects; the transition between levels of education; and education and economics. Each meeting began with a presentation that described the current situation, identified existing problems and offered resolutions. A synopsis of the presentations is given in the minutes. The March 9, 1971 minutes refer to admissions, curriculum, economic and creative arts subcommittees and their status. The curriculum subcommittee noted they were awaiting survey results from undergraduate representatives of each department.\n\n In 1971 a survey of undergraduates was conducted by associate professor of sociology Robert A. Scott. Initiated by ten juniors in the Department of Sociology, the purpose of the survey was to allow these students to complete their junior papers and senior theses while also providing information for three faculty reports. The collection does not contain results or interpretations of this survey. Another survey, the Bressler Undergraduate Survey Project, questioned members of each class about future plans and solicited their opinions regarding examinations. Again, while there are questionnaires in the collection, there are no results. Newell Brown of Career Services conducted a third survey from 1964-1969.
