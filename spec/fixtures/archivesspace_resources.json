These restrictions may be revised from time to time at the initiation of either party.\n\n Consistent with its support of freedom of information and informed public discourse on matters of public interest, the American Civil Liberties Union Records will be completely open to researchers. However, sections of the Records shall be closed for stated periods of time to protect privacy, confidentiality, and attorney-client privilege. The following categories of records shall be restricted as indicated below:\n\n Personnel Records - Records which deal with personnel issues, whether in personnel files or in other files maintained by the ACLU shall be closed during the lifetime of the person to whom they apply. When scattered personnel records are present in open files, they shall be governed by this paragraph. This restriction shall not apply if the person or persons to whom the record applies have given their permission in writing to disclose said information.\n\n Administrative Records - Records maintained by ACLU administrators (Board and Executive committee members, officers, executives, department heads, project directors, etc.) shall be closed for twenty years after the creation of the record or ten years after its deposit in the Princeton University Library, whichever is later, but in no case for more than 30 years after the creation of the record. Personnel records will continue to be closed as provided above.\n\n Development Records - Records relating to financial support from foundations or other legal entities but not individuals or their family foundations shall be closed for the same period as administrative records. Records relating to financial support by individual donors or their family foundations shall be returned to the ACLU if other more substantive issues relating to policy are not raised by the correspondence. When other issues are relevant, these records shall be closed for the same period as administrative records. Where opened the portions relating to individuals or their family foundations shall be treated like personnel records as provided below.\n\n Legal Case Records - Legal Case Files shall be segregated into four categories:\n\n 1) Open Records - publicly-available materials relating to the case (public court records such as briefs, transcripts, exhibits, and judgments as well as other records such as press releases and media coverage) shall be open immediately upon transfer to Princeton.\n\n 2) Work Product Privileged Records - correspondence, memoranda, drafts of briefs prepared in anticipation of litigation, written statements of witnesses, and notes of mental impressions or personal recollections prepared or formed by an attorney shall be open twenty years after the closure of the case.\n\n 3) Attorney-Client Privileged Records - any document reflecting an exchange with a client or a potential client (including but not limited to written correspondence, memoranda to the file, notes, or any other report of communication to or from a client or potential client) made for the purpose of furnishing or obtaining professional legal advice and assistance shall be closed for seventy-five years for all clients, except for children where the period of closure shall be one hundred years.\n\n 4) The access rules set forth above do not apply to the following materials: classified documents; documents that have been placed under seal by a court or are subject to a protective order; documents that identify by name or otherwise clients that have been represented anonymously or pseudonymously; the terms of any confidential settlement or agreement. All such documents shall remain permanently closed unless the records are declassified, unsealed, the protective order is modified, or the client or the client's legal representative waives the privilege in writing.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"persistent_id":"fc7196868ad0813de570a3cde10a179e","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"1a876670045c012688cd4973583547f3","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"Single photocopies may be made for research purposes.

Decker. The majority of personal correspondence is to Decker's future wife, Gertrude V. O'Brien. The letters, arranged chronologically, describe Decker's activities as a member of the American Advisory Commission of Railway Experts to Russia and reveal Decker's perspective on revolutionary Russia from 1917 to 1919. Included are detailed descriptions of Vladivostok, Harbin, and an account of the July Riots (July Days) in Petrograd, as well as a description of the Cossacks (and one of their leaders, Grigori Semenov) and their role in the revolution. A small amount of newspaper clippings and materials related to events around Decker's experiences is also found. Most of this correspondence has been published in Mission to Russia: An American Journal (Edited by Charles J. Decker, self-published, New York: 1994).\n\n The business correspondence focuses on John F. Stevens's work as President of the Inter-Allied Technical Board for which Decker served as secretary. This correspondence is divided into three sections. The first contains Stevens's personal business files from July 26, 1919 to November 21, 1922, arranged chronologically by outgoing correspondence. The materials range from invitations to social events from Russian, Chinese and Japanese officials to letters from American and Canadian firms asking about possible business opportunities. Also included is a letter from an ex-member of the Chinese Eastern Railway Council who was arrested in Petrograd in 1918. He, and the other members of the Council, sought compensation after their release.\n\n The second section contains correspondence Stevens received from the American Representative to the Technical Board, C.H. Smith, from April 30, 1919 to June 8, 1921, arranged chronologically by incoming letter. Much of the correspondence discusses Japanese presence in the region and the Allies' role in the internal conflicts of Russia. Also included are several detailed accounts of disturbances along the rail line such as impounding equipment and the harassment and murder of passengers. Copies of most of the memoranda are included; however enclosures (letters/invoices/telegrams) are not included in the files.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true}],"persistent_id":"03b58c0b67272cf696ef410c1d66e05c","publish":true},{"subnotes":[{"content":"The collection is separated into correspondence and photograph and arranged chronologically within those categories.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true}],"type":"arrangement","persistent_id":"e1c2beaf6c2bd1ee1414e4c900122237","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"02d9eef39886e471f21558c57ea68e8c","type":"accessrestrict","rights_restriction":{"local_access_restriction_type":[]},"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"content":"Collection is open for research use.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"publish":true},{"persistent_id":"be0c317696b8e3b0204313360cf3abf9","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"Single photocopies may be made for research purposes.

Robinson, a businessman, and Elizabeth Robinson, grew up in West Collingswood, New Jersey, and attended Camden High School. He graduated from Princeton University in 1931 with a degree in history. In 1937 Robinson earned a Ph.D. in history at the University of Pennsylvania. Beginning in 1941 Robinson served in a series of increasingly responsible positions, rising to Editor in the Office of Coordinator of Information, which was part of the Executive Office of the President. \"This propaganda arm of the government...is truly America's most formidable secret weapon,\" he wrote at the time. By the end of the year he had complete charge of all contacts with the Intelligence branches of the Army and Navy for the OCI. From 1942-45 Robinson was Chief War Correspondent for the United Nations News Service in the Mediterranean theatre.\n\n After the war Robinson served as an army information specialist and Foreign Service officer. In late 1945 Robinson was appointed chief press officer, Indonesia, within the Office of Information and Cultural Affairs. Between 1945-47 Robinson lived in Italy, India, Singapore, and French Indochina. In the 1948 class directory, Robinson described himself as the assistant public affairs officer for the Office of Information and Cultural Affairs in the Department of State at the American Embassy in Manila. Between 1949 and 1952 Robinson lived in Poland, and then in Korea in 1952, where he became Secretary of Embassy and Director of Information in Pusan. It was there on October 30, 1952 that Robinson married Madeline Law, a graduate of Radcliffe College and also a member of the U.S. Foreign Service.\n\n Robinson returned to the United States in 1953, retired from the Foreign Service, and served as the secretary-treasurer of the Joseph W. Graham Company, a family-owned industrial coal business in Camden, New Jersey.\n\n He retired from his business career in 1962. He and Madeline moved from Moorestown, New Jersey, to St. Michaels, Maryland, where they lived on the San Domingo Creek. He pursued his lifelong hobby of sailing, and the Robinsons maintained a waterfowl refuge. \"We are all refugees together from an uncertain civilization,\" he wrote in his 40th Reunion book. The Robinsons became Trustees of the Maryland Ornithological Society. Robinson wrote \"British Invade the Chesapeake, 1777,\" which was part of Chesapeake Bay in the American Revolution, edited by Rear Admiral E. M. Eller, and published in 1980 by Tidewater Press.\n\n Robinson passed away on April 4, 1998 in Easton, Maryland at the age of 87.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","publish":true},{"subnotes":[{"content":"Robinson was involved in the establishment of informational and cultural affairs agencies in India, Saigon and Warsaw, and in his letters describes both the internal politics and external challenges of establishing an American news presence abroad. Robinson's account of the creation of the Saigon office is especially thorough.\n\n At the beginning of the correspondence run, Robinson has just been offered a position in the Office of the Coordinator of Information. Early in his correspondence Robinson asks his mother to save his letters for a possible book he would write upon his return (but did not). He also cautioned his family to keep the contents of his correspondence private: \"We were told treason charges face the first man to let anything out.\" Perhaps with a future memoir in mind, he wrote full and lyrical descriptions of many places he visited. The letters are vivid in their descriptions of places and events. He was very meticulous about ensuring the continuity of events in his accounts.\n\n Many of the details in his correspondence concern ordinary daily life - inquiring after relatives and friends, discussing the sale and purchase of various boats (Robinson was an avid sailor), and social events with friends. The letters are less revealing about some important events - the bombing of Pearl Harbor, for example - but are valuable for their description of the atmosphere and growing unease that preceded them.\n\n During this time Robinson had several personal encounters of note. Perhaps most significantly he was one of two American journalists present at a luncheon with \"M. Matthieu,\" the leader of one of the eight major French resistance groups. \"Matthieu\" described to the assembled group a clandestine meeting in Paris of these organizations with a special representative dispatched by de Gaulle in May of 1943; that meeting produced a written contract stating that once the Council of Resistance could come into the open, it would supersede de Gaulle as the directing power in France, and would push forward the work of evicting the Nazis on its own account. (11/23/43) \"The importance of this is hardly to be overestimated,\" Robinson wrote. Robinson had met personally with de Gaulle a year earlier in November of 1942.\n\n Robinson also had an unusual opportunity to meet privately for several hours with Mahatma Gandhi in Calcutta in December of 1945. At the time Gandhi had accompanied Bengalese governor Richard Casey on a trip to observe the effects of the 1943 famine, and Robinson was able to arrange an afternoon visit. Robinson was also present at the assassination attempt against President Syngman Rhee in Korea in July 1952.\n\n There is a vivid description of the occasion upon which Robinson was a member of the official party that accompanied French High Commissioner Admiral Georges-Thierry d'Argenlieu on a visit of state to the Cambodian Court on the occasion of the announcement of autonomy. Robinson's relationship with d'Argenlieu was somewhat tense; he believed the Admiral was well aware that Robinson had been placed under surveillance by the French civil and military police. Robinson had been warned indirectly that \"[his] presence here in Indochina was considered a grave challenge to certain ‘powerful interests.’\" Once d'Argenlieu lost power, Robinson again felt assured of his personal safety.\n\n Of lesser note is Robinson's description of his public support of radical feminist writer Josephine Herbst's labor efforts on behalf of workers at Ford Motors; shortly thereafter his working hours change from dayside to the overnight shift, a move he believes \"is not unconnected with my championing of Josephine Herbst's cause.\" Also of interest is his vivid depiction of the landing of French troops at Haipong in March of 1946.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","type":"scopecontent","persistent_id":"20705ea1b326eb873b0a04a66166d609","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"a0c820261cc97e0b74e8802c9b273582","type":"arrangement","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"content":"The collection contains personal correspondence, arranged chronologically, from Robinson to his family, primarily his mother, during the years he was in the Office of War Information in the United States Department of State, and later in the Foreign Service.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"publish":true},{"type":"accessrestrict","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true,"content":"Joseph A.

He served on faculty at the University of Chicago, 1943-1957, Oxford University 1957-1958, and the University of Hawaii starting in 1966. He died in June 1985.\n\n In 1952 Johnson became co-chairman, along with Leo Lerner, of the National Committee for Stevenson for President. This committee was organized by members of the Independent Voters of Illinois, a liberal group that became the nucleus of the state chapter of Americans for Democratic Action. With the help of Johnson and this committee, Stevenson received the Democratic presidential nomination in 1952. After Stevenson's defeat to Dwight D. Eisenhower, Johnson accompanied Stevenson on his world tour in 1953.\n\n Over the years, Johnson wrote and edited numerous books.

Jenks Papers document his research on the Cuban sugar industry, as well as his broader research into the economic and financial affairs of the country and its relationship with the United States. A portion of the research was used for his book Our Cuban Colony: A Study in Sugar, published in 1928 as part of a series on American imperialism. The papers include Jenks's notes from interviews and materials he collected regarding the Cuban sugar industry.\n\n Jenks's notes include interviews with bankers, businessmen, administrators and laborers at sugar production facilities, government officials, and professors in the United States and in Cuba. The notes from 1925 to 1926 focus on banking and finance in Cuba, especially with regards to the Banco Nacional, and also include discussions of financial relations and trade with the United States, and the Cuban sugar industry. The notes from a 1934 trip to Cuba focus on the sugar industry and include subjects such as worker conditions, the sugar production process, the success and failure of businesses, sugar taxes and quotas, and American businessmen in Cuba. The notes also include his observations from traveling around the country and visiting sugar mills and other production facilities.\n\n The remainder of the collection is composed of materials Jenks collected about the Cuban sugar industry.

The interviews also describe the participants' personal memories of how the writings were produced and distributed.

His family moved to Greencastle, IN in 1913. Sweet continued to reside in Indiana until he graduated from DePauw University in 1929, after which time he studied as a rector fellow at universities in Goettingen and Munich. Sweet initially enrolled as a graduate student in the history department at the University of Chicago, but would eventually receive his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin in 1934. His thesis was later published as the book Friedrich Von Gentz, Defender of the Old Order (1941). Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Sweet taught European history at Bates College, Birmingham-Southern College, Colby College, and the University of Chicago.\n\n From 1943-1945, Sweet was a political intelligence officer for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in the Research and Analysis (R and A) branch. Sweet served with the OSS in London, Salzburg, Paris, Italy, and Washington, D.C. For much of Sweet's service with the OSS, he worked on intelligence concerning Austria, at one point serving as the head of the R and A's Central European section in London. Sweet also worked for the Psychological Warfare Branch of the Twelfth Army Group, where his main duty was to create a series of political intelligence reports based on interviews with German civilians.\n\n From 1952-1958, Sweet worked for the U.S. State Department as editor-in-chief on the 19-volume Documents on German Foreign Policy, 1918-1945, a historical editing project sponsored jointly by the British and French governments. From February 1959-November 1963, he served at the U.S. Embassy in Bonn, and from 1963-1967 he was U.S. Consul General in Stuttgart. From 1968 until at least 1974, he taught history at Michigan State University. Sweet's other publications include The Tragedy of Austria (1948) and Wilhelm von Humboldt: a Biography, 1767-1808 (1978).\n\n Sweet died on November 5, 2003 in Philadelphia at the age of 96."}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"MC272_b1","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The majority of the collection relates to Paul R.

These documents also speak more broadly to the attitudes of the German population during the war. Many of the materials related to Sweet's OSS service are annotated with Sweet's commentary on the documents, written sometime after the war. Sweet's application for federal employment is also included.\n\n To a lesser extent, the collection contains correspondence and Sweet's typewritten memoir from his tenure serving as U.S. Consul General in Stuttgart in the 1960s, as well as interviews he gave on his teaching career. Correspondence between Sweet and numerous friends and colleagues from the late 1970s-1990s is also included. Most of the correspondence pertains to Sweet's work as a historian and to German philosophy and history more generally, though Sweet's correspondence with several authors and historians details Sweet's service in the OSS.\n\n The collection also contains materials that document Sweet's relationships with his family. These materials include correspondence from Paul R. Sweet to his brother and sister-in-law, JoAnne and William W. Sweet, Jr., and correspondence from historian William W. Sweet, son of Paul R. and Kathryn Sweet, to his parents and his sister and brother-in-law, Sarah and Gerald Rosen.

In the mid-1950s, the organization often focused on the abuses of American civil liberties that characterized the McCarthy era. When the Fund shifted its base of operation from New York City to Santa Barbara, California in 1959, Ferry moved with the organization, now called the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, and became its staff director. His responsibilities as administrator of the Fund included research, publication of a magazine, and organizing conferences. On August 7, 1962, Mr. Ferry delivered a speech titled \"Myths, Cliches and Stereotypes\" to the Western States Democratic Conference in Seattle, Washington where he spoke out against the rarely criticized head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, J. Edgar Hoover. The storm of protest that followed led to a denouncement from Attorney General Robert Kennedy, an attack on the floor of the Senate by Iowa Republican Bourke B. Hickenlooper, and bitter attacks by the press across the country."],"type":"abstract","persistent_id":"ab96ed89ac424f8a117f3f55ec09bca5","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_singlepart","content":["mudd"],"type":"physloc","persistent_id":"57e593a6487e70ea0caf924aee8d724a","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"e95f1f01dfa05ff65a9c08d3fab9a2f8","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The Wilbur Hugh Ferry Papers consist of documents related to Ferry's speech, \"Myths, Cliches and Stereotypes\", which he gave to the Western States Democratic Conference in Seattle, Washington on 7 August 1962. Since the speech attacked Federal Bureau of Investigation Director J. Edgar Hoover, it generated a nationwide response from the media and many letters, favorable and unfavorable, from the public. Included in this collection are reference materials, collected by Ferry regarding a former FBI agent, Jack Levine, and his claim that many FBI agents were members of the Communist Party acting as informants. Ferry also saved news clippings about the American news reporter, James Worthy, Jr., who was sentenced to three months in prison for illegally re-entering the United States from Cuba without a passport. J. Edgar Hoover's speech to the American Legion on 9 October 1962, which makes reference to Ferry's Seattle speech, is also part of this collection. Lastly, the collection is completed with a memorandum from the Ad Hoc Committee on the Triple Revolution sent to President Lyndon B. Johnson by a group of economists, labor leaders, publishers and writers headed by Ferry. This memorandum asserts that revolutions are occurring in three fields in the United States: \"cybernation\" (a term Ferry describes as the combination of computer technology and automated self-regulating machines that will require progressively less human labor), weaponry and human rights. The committee believed these revolutions would lead to fundamental changes in the approach to jobs and work."}],"type":"scopecontent","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"607d630d712f4ab8bb3f1f3c7b579952","subnotes":[{"content":"This collection is arranged chronologically.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"type":"arrangement","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","publish":true},{"subnotes":[{"content":"Collection is open for research use.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"rights_restriction":{"local_access_restriction_type":[]},"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","persistent_id":"83c71a4054a9591dd667d3330fb433c2","type":"accessrestrict","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"d4479ccb76d4ac8899001f7d795a0040","subnotes":[{"content":"Single photocopies may be made for research purposes.

Russell were both Presbyterian pastors, Alexander Russell in Oyster Bay and Gordon Russell in Merchantville, New Jersey.\n\n Reverend Alexander G. Russell was born on October 6, 1845 in Nova Scotia, Canada. Russell received his A.B. from Dalhousie College in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1873. He married Eliza Hoxie Norris on August 1, 1876 and they had three sons: Henry N., Gordon M., and Alexander, all of whom attended Princeton University. Russell served as pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Oyster Bay, Long Island, New York, where he was known as an eloquent speaker and an energetic charitable worker. He was also a friend of former President Roosevelt, who sometimes attended his services. Russell died in 1911.\n\n Reverend Gordon MacGregor Russell was born on April 30, 1880 to the Reverend Alexander G. Russell and Eliza Hoxie Russell. He grew up as a neighbor of Theodore Roosevelt and tutored his children for a short time. Russell gradated from Princeton University in 1901 and received his A.M. degree, also from Princeton, in 1902. He taught at various schools for a time, and then in 1905 entered the Princeton Theological Seminary, graduating in 1908 with a B.D. Russell next studied at the University of Berlin, Germany from 1908 to 1909 with a traveling fellowship from the Princeton Theological Seminary. From 1909 to 1914, Russell served as assistant pastor of the Presbyterian Church at Cranford, New Jersey, and was also in charge of a small church in nearby Garwood. He then served as assistant pastor at the Bethlehem Church in Philadelphia from 1914 to 1917. Russell joined the Y.M.C.A. during World War I, serving British and then American troops from 1917 to 1919. Once he returned to the United States, Russell became pastor of the Presbyterian Church at Merchantville, New Jersey, where he remained until his death in 1933."}],"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","persistent_id":"MC114_b1","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"0eb0ebd6d9a3f57b95c4c80e7fc61e15","type":"scopecontent","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The majority of the Theodore Roosevelt Family Letters to the Russell Family collection consists of personal letters written by Theodore Roosevelt and members of his family to Gordon M.

Willard (Bill) Wirtz was a lawyer, an arbitrator, a law professor, and served as undersecretary and secretary of labor under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. He was a speechwriter for and close advisor to Adlai Stevenson from 1952 to 1960. He was born on March 14, 1912 and raised in Illinois.\n\n After Stevenson’s election as governor of Illinois in 1948, he appointed Wirtz a member of the state’s Liquor Control Commission. Wirtz had earned a law degree from Harvard and was a law professor at Northwestern University. He had also served on the War Labor Board and had been chairman of the National Wage Stabilization Board. When Stevenson was drafted by the Democratic Party to run for president in 1952, Wirtz became one of a dozen or so of Stevenson’s speechwriters. The illustrious group also included Truman staffer David Bell, journalist John B. Martin, economists John Kenneth Galbraith and Robert Tufts, and history professor Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. Wirtz and his colleagues called themselves the Elks Club Group after the building in which they worked in Springfield, Illinois.\n\n John Martin, later wrote a biography of Stevenson that describes Wirtz as \"a big, crew-cut man from Winnetka\" who was \"tense, abstemious, almost painfully loyal to Stevenson, and he kept to himself more than other members of the Elks Club Group.\" Wirtz was the labor expert amongst the speechwriters, but like his colleagues, contributed speech drafts and edits on every subject. Stevenson did not like the idea that he wrote few of his speeches himself, and he rarely interacted directly with (or even acknowledged the existence of) his speechwriters during his first presidential campaign. Most communication between the candidate and his speechwriters occurred through Carl McGowan, Stevenson’s campaign manager.\n\n In the late summer of 1955, when Stevenson was preparing a second run for the presidency, he convened a meeting of a dozen or so close advisors, including Wirtz. Tom Finletter, a former secretary of the air force, and Wirtz were assigned to run the campaign’s research section. Wirtz was in charge of approving speech content, performing a role that McGowan had assumed in the first campaign. Martin, in his Stevenson biography, described the 1956 speechwriting operation as \"less happy-go-lucky, less brilliant, but far more solid than the Elks Club of 1952.\" Unlike 1952, Wirtz had Stevenson’s ear in 1956 and quickly became one of Stevenson’s top two or three advisors. Martin remarks that \"Wirtz found it harder than McGowan to say no to Stevenson.\"\n\n Between campaigns, Wirtz taught law, worked on the occasional Stevenson speech, and arbitrated cases. After the 1956 campaign, Wirtz, Stevenson, and a few others formed a law firm that strictly abstained from politics.\n\n By 1960, Wirtz was a trusted and close advisor to Stevenson. Unlike the early days, Stevenson would often send memorandums directly to Wirtz, who would promptly respond back. By the 1960 Democratic Convention, Stevenson was frustrated that the media and other politicians kept hounding him to declare whether or not he was running for president. On the plane trip to the convention in Los Angeles, he dashed out a terse, peevish statement that he intended to read at the airport. He handed it to Wirtz to look over. When Stevenson later asked him about the statement, Wirtz replied that he must have \"lost\" it. Stevenson smiled, and delivered his previously planned speech. Wirtz continued to advise and write speeches for Stevenson as he campaigned across the country that fall for John F. Kenendy, the eventual Democratic nominee.\n\n When Kennedy assumed office, he appointed Wirtz undersecretary of labor. In 1962, Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg was selected to be a United States Supreme Court justice. Wirtz was promoted to secretary of labor, a position in which he served through the end of Lyndon Johnson’s presidency. He earned the respect of liberals for staunchly valuing \"human interests\" over economic interests, and for his principled objections to the Vietnam War. Though Wirtz and Stevenson continued to correspond periodically until Stevenson’s death, Wirtz no longer directly advised Stevenson on policy issues or contributed to Stevenson’s speeches.\n\n After Stevenson’s death in July 1965, Wirtz was asked by President Johnson and many of Stevenson’s family, friends, and associates to participate in the establishment of various memorial funds, programs, and institutes. Through the end of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first, Wirtz has continued to comment on Stevenson’s life and legacy, including at a conference on Stevenson at Princeton University in 2000.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"persistent_id":"MC149_b1","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","persistent_id":"cc574bc7ec7bf51fbeb8317c70ed7f90","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The W.

The majority of Bogle's speeches were delivered while he was at Vanguard, but also include some earlier speeches while he was employed by Wellington, and were presented at meetings of professional organization, universities and business classes, and to Vanguard employees. In the speeches, Bogle discussed mutual funds, investing strategies, the success of Vanguard, critiques of the mutual fund industry, the responsibilities of companies to their investors, and capitalism. Bogle's correspondence is largely with colleagues in the investment and financial industries or investors and discusses mutual funds, investing, and Vanguard. The letters include deliberations on the ideas presented in Bogle's writings and the writings of others, letters from satisfied investors, congratulatory letters from colleagues as Bogle reached milestones in his career, and invitations to events. The correspondence also includes letters from employees of Vanguard about their ideas and concerns for the company, and with fund directors on managing the funds.\n\n The remaining papers include materials pertaining to the Security and Exchange Commission and to Bogle's career at Vanguard and Wellington. The Security and Exchange Commission materials include papers pertaining to rulings by the SEC about Vanguard and reports and correspondence submitted by Bogle and Vanguard to the SEC leadership with their opinions on the mutual fund industry. The main subjects include advertising, the independence of auditors, and the responsibilities of companies to investors. The papers related to Bogle's career at Vanguard include reports on the funds' performances and objectives, articles on indexing and Vanguard's first index fund, and organizational materials on Vanguard such as strategic planning documents, press releases, SEC hearings, and a manual for the board of directors. The papers related to Bogle's career at Wellington include his articles on mutual funds and reports to employees, clippings on Wellington and the investment industry, and reports, meeting minutes, and memoranda on the restructuring of Wellington in 1974 that resulted in the formation of Vanguard.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"publish":true},{"subnotes":[{"content":"The Papers are arranged alphabetically by subject or document type.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"type":"arrangement","persistent_id":"ce4a06e6cace64959c103974cb73973b","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"4aa494753d09a089be5fdc17c8d2ab88","type":"accessrestrict","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","rights_restriction":{"local_access_restriction_type":[]},"subnotes":[{"content":"The collection is open for research.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","persistent_id":"6817d8a27486a560d306bb87a99d6b15","type":"phystech","subnotes":[{"content":"Thirteen VHS tapes of Bogle's television appearances are located in Box 10.

Eisenhower during both of his administrations and later served as chief of staff to Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller. She attended a year of secretarial school at the Spencerian School in Cleveland and then entered Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio in 1926, majoring in accounting and literature. The school's schedule alternated six weeks of class with six weeks of working. During her sophomore year, she worked as a typist at the New York Institute for Child Guidance in New York City, and when she was promoted to secretary of the director of the Institute, Dr. Lawson Lowry, she decided not to return to college. Whitman worked there until the Institute was closed in 1933, and soon obtained employment as personal secretary to Dr. Levy's wife, Adele Rosenwald Levy, a philanthropist and daughter of the owner of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company. She left the position in 1949, but the two remained friends. During the early 1950s, Whitman worked for the Committee for a Free Europe, which ran Radio Free Europe.\n\n Whitman was working as a secretary at Citizens for Eisenhower in New York in 1952 when she was asked to work in Dever for two weeks to help organize Eisenhower's headquarters, three weeks before the Republican National Convention. Due to the illness of Eisenhower's secretary, Whitman was pressed into service in this position. The two developed a working rapport, and she remained his personal secretary for the rest of the presidential campaign and through both of Eisenhower's administrations. As his personal secretary, Whitman's role was to run his office, a job which routinely required twelve hour workdays, often seven days a week. Her main responsibility was supervising the President's responses to correspondence, numbering hundreds of thousands of letters a year. Letters were either dictated to her by Eisenhower, written by her to be signed by the President, or answered by her on behalf of Eisenhower. She also supervised the typists who typed the final letters, listened in on his phone conversations to take notes (a common practice at the time), and took dictation for his speeches and prepared notes for use in delivering them. She also traveled with him around the world as he attended meetings with national leaders and on his three \"international goodwill tours,\" and accompanied him on trips to his Gettysburg farm and to Camp David. Her first trip to Europe was in 1955 for the Geneva Conference. Whitman continued to work for him for two years after he left the White House, until 1961. She worked briefly for Republican Citizens, in Washington, and then return to New York.\n\n Whitman obtained a job with George L. Hinman, political advisor to Nelson A. Rockefeller, Governor of New York, in 1961. She became the Governor's personal secretary in 1965, and later his executive assistant. When Rockefeller was named Vice President by President Gerald R. Ford in 1974, he made Whitman his chief of staff, making her the first woman to ever hold that position. She found herself in a difficult role; accustomed to speaking frankly and with her previous experience working for Eisenhower, she frequently warned Rockefeller that he was attempting to do things that were the domain of the president. She also faced tension in working with other White House staff, being female and working for the unpopular Rockefeller. Rockefeller replaced Whitman as chief of staff with Susan Herter in June 1975, six months after they had come to the White House. Whitman returned to New York, still working for Rockefeller by handling his personal affairs, until she retired in June 1977.\n\n Whitman was born Ann Elizabeth Cook in Perry, Ohio on June 11, 1908 to Willis Wood and Esther Few Cook. Whitman married Clarence Willard Moore in 1933, and the marriage ended amicably in divorce after seven years. Whitman married Edmund S. Whitman, public relations executive and later vice-president of United Fruit Company, in 1940 and they divorced in 1961. Whitman died on October 15, 1991 at the age of 83."}],"type":"bioghist","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"0348a4465e93da8ef53ba1f0ffa3adef","subnotes":[{"content":"Whitman's Papers on John Foster Dulles consist of photocopies of a portion of Whitman's files concerning secretaries of state John Foster Dulles and Christian A.

Somerset Maugham, reveal Armour's more jocular side as well as his own story-telling abilities.Letters to his father describe his new surroundings in Paris and the mundane details of making travel arrangements and renovating the flat (\"We are meeting the electricians, painters, plumbers, etc. at the apartment on that day and they will then ‘take possession’ for another five or six weeks....\")."}],"type":"scopecontent","persistent_id":"6d5f53af5753b9b8ecbcb9f47b8d0103","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"content":"The correspondence in this collection is arranged alphabetically by the sender.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true}],"type":"arrangement","persistent_id":"1aa0321d0df401827828b1d44f2d6fec","publish":true},{"type":"accessrestrict","persistent_id":"6dadf389ff17895ee615f20a00111baa","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"Collection is open for research use."}],"rights_restriction":{"local_access_restriction_type":[]},"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","persistent_id":"d86cb83c59395751c0bf689e726b76d2","subnotes":[{"content":"Single photocopies may be made for research purposes.

A member of the Princeton University Class of 1930, he graduated cum laude with an A.B. in history. In 1931, he joined the Foreign Service and was posted to Seville, Spain. While steadily rising in the ranks of the Foreign Service he worked in legations and embassies in Argentina, Estonia, and Mexico, among other locations.\n\n After World War II, Trimble was a member of the first class at the National War College. Upon completion of his studies, he went to Reykjavik, Iceland as Chargé d'Affaires and Second Secretary and then as First Secretary in 1948. Two years later he became Counselor of the embassy at London. The State Department transferred him in late 1951 to The Hague where he remained until spring 1954 as Counselor and Deputy Chief of Mission.\n\n In March 1954, Trimble moved to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil as second in command of the embassy. That same year he attained the personal rank of minister, the second highest rank in the Foreign Service. While in Brazil, Trimble witnessed the end of the Vargas era that culminated with Getulio Vargas's suicide and elections for a new president in 1955. At the end of January 1956, the embassy played host to Vice President Richard Nixon during his visit to Brazil as the United States representative at the inauguration of Juscelino Kubitschek as President of Brazil.\n\n In September 1956, Trimble returned to Europe to serve as Deputy Chief of Mission at Bonn, Germany. He served under Ambassador James Conant and then welcomed David Bruce as ambassador in 1957. Trimble served in Germany during the dissolution of the U.S. High Commission after it was abolished by the Allied High Commission. Its functions were transferred to the U.S. embassy in Bonn, and Trimble played an integral role in this process.\n\n The culmination of Trimble's long diplomatic career came in February 1959 when he became the United States Ambassador to Cambodia. Trimble arrived in Cambodia in the midst of a political crisis over Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) involvement with Dap Chhuon, a political adversary of Prince Sihanouk, who headed a brief rebellion. This crisis was shortly followed on August 31 by the death of a palace staff member who opened a suitcase containing the card of an American engineer. The general consensus among Cambodians was that the United States was responsible for an attempt on Prince Sihanouk's life. Trimble's position was very difficult due to Sihanouk's distrust of the United States. In September 1960, Sihanouk effectively ended American hopes of gaining Cambodia as an ally against Communism by expressing Cambodian neutrality during a United Nations speech.\n\n Upon his return to the United States in September 1962, Trimble became Director of the Office of West Coast and Malian Affairs. The Office oversaw U.S. relations with seven countries: Guinea, Nigeria, Liberia, Togo, Mali, Sierra Leone, and Ghana. Trimble visited four of these countries - Nigeria, Togo, Ghana and Liberia - to gain first-hand experience for his new post. To deal with increasingly important African affairs, the Africa Desk was reorganized as the Office of West African Affairs with seven additional countries placed under its supervision: Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia, Dahomey (now Bénin), Côte d'Ivoire, Niger, and Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso).

His father, a salesman, and mother, a homemaker, later relocated the family to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He attended Wesleyan University (Class of 1944) where he received an A.B. with high honors and was elected Phi Beta Kappa. After graduation, Tillett interned as an Information Specialist for the Presidentŉs Committee on Fair Employment Practice. He left Washington and earned a J.D. from the University of Chicago Law School in 1949. The following year, Tillett served as a research assistant in the Law College, University of Nebraska. In 1950, he became a research assistant in the Department of Politics at Princeton University. He applied and was admitted to the graduate program at Princeton University, where he obtained an M.A. and Ph.D. in political science in 1953 and 1957 respectively. While at Princeton, he received a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship for the 1952-1953 academic year and served as an instructor in the Political Science Department.\n\n In 1957, Tillett was appointed to the teaching faculty of Douglass College, Rutgers University, where he also served as the Assistant Director of its Eagleton Institute of Politics. While at Eagleton, he edited a series of case studies in practical politics designed to bring actual political situations into the classroom. He received wide acclaim in 1965 for his five month television course entitled \"A New Birth of Freedom: Civil Rights and Civil Liberties,\" a part of WCBS televisionŉs Sunrise Semester program.\n\n Tillett received a grant from the Louis Rabinowitz Foundation in 1961 to study the social costs of the loyalty investigations. In the course of conducting the study, he sought out people who had, in one way or the other, been involved with the anti-Communist frenzy of the 1950s. Among those he contacted was Herbert Aptheker of the American Institute for Marxist Studies. This association raised the suspicion of the F.B.I. which began to investigate Tillett in 1965. After discussing the study with Tillett and his colleagues, the F.B.I. concluded that Apethekerŉs role was purely academic.\n\n On the morning of September 26, 1966, Paul D. Tillett, Jr. suffered a fatal heart attack. He left behind a wife and three children.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"type":"bioghist","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"35572c300dc968b8def4643e3c2b19b4","type":"scopecontent","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"content":"The papers of Paul D.

He earned bachelor's degrees from both Brown University and the University of Wisconsin, and went on to receive a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Pennsylvania. Munro then spent two years studying economic and political conditions in Central America for the Carnegie Peace Foundation. After serving in the U.S. Army's Air Service during World War I, the State Department hired him as an economist in 1919; during the 1920s, he was the acting chief, and later chief, of its Latin American Division. Among his diplomatic positions, he was a secretary of legation in Panama and Nicaragua, charge d'affairs in Managua, a special envoy to Haiti, a consul to Chile, and minister to Haiti (1930-1932).\n\n Munro's career as an educator began in 1930 when he was hired as a professor of Latin American History at Princeton University. Nine years later, he became director of the University's School of Public and International Affairs. After his retirement from academia in 1961, Munro returned to an earlier role as president of the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council, a component of the State Department intended to advise in the protection of American investors.\n\n Munro contributed to journals such as the Hispanic American Historical Review and The American Political Science Review, and authored several monographs including The Latin American Republics: a History; A Student in Central America, 1914-1916; Intervention and Dollar Diplomacy in the Caribbean, 1900-1921; and The United States and the Caribbean Republics, 1921-1933.\n\n He died in June 1990 at the age of 97."}],"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","type":"bioghist","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"8d5a52e763be4323e9b7b13c2fab984e","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The Dana Gardner Munro Papers document segments of the scholarly and diplomatic work of Munro.

Born Thomas Woodrow Wilson in late December 1856 in Staunton, Virginia, Wilson was the son of Dr. Joseph Ruggles Wilson, Presbyterian minister and director of the Augusta Female Seminary, and Janet Woodrow. Wilson began his college career at Davidson near Charlotte, North Carolina, but after a year there and a further year under his father's tutelage came to Princeton University. Wilson was expected to study for the ministry, but at Davidson he developed an interest in politics. He carried this interest to Princeton, where he studied and read extensively in history and politics. After graduating from Princeton in 1879, Wilson returned to the south to attend law school at the University of Virginia; he passed the Georgia bar and briefly practiced law in Atlanta. However, Wilson abandoned law practice in Georgia to pursue an advanced degree in historical and political science at the Johns Hopkins University . He received his doctorate in two years and, after successive professorships at Bryn Mawr College (1885) and Wesleyan University (1888), Wilson joined the Princeton faculty in 1890 as Professor of Jurisprudence and Political Economy. Wilson had married Ellen Axson on 24 June 1885, and their family soon expanded with the birth of three daughters.\n\n During his time at Princeton, Wilson published four major works: Division and Reunion, George Washington, Mere Literature and Other Essays, and An Old Master and Other Publication. A notable event in Wilson's professorial career at Princeton occurred on the occasion of the Sesquicentennial (or 150th birthday) in 1896, when the College of New Jersey officially became Princeton University. At this celebration, Wilson delivered his famous speech, \"Princeton in the Nation's Service,\" in which he proposed the following ideal for the Princeton student: seek the education required to carry into the world a sense of duty and purpose for the nation. Wilson was chosen president of Princeton in 1902. He immediately revised the academic structure of the University dividing the faculty into four areas: Philosophy, Art and Archaeology, Languages and Literature, and Mathematics and Science and introducing the preceptorial system. Wilson also attempted to abolish Princeton's eating clubs through his \"Quadrangle Plan,\" which eventually was defeated. This conflict was followed by Wilson's battle with Dean Andrew Fleming West and the Trustees in 1908 over the location of the new Graduate College. Wilson favored a central location for the school, but West favored its placement away from campus. Wilson lost this fight.\n\n During the summer of 1910, Wilson accepted the Democratic nomination for Governor of New Jersey. Wilson won the election with the assistance of Democratic political bosses, but soon distanced himself from them with his progressive agenda as the people's advocate against special interests. His progressive policies made Wilson a good candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1912, and he won the nomination with the support and assistance of Edward M. House, William Jennings Bryan, and William Gibbs McAdoo. Wilson also won the presidency, and used his techniques of presidential leadership to gain the adoption of his New Freedom agenda. He advocated three major reforms: the reduction of import tariffs, banking and currency reform, and antitrust reform. In his family relations, Wilson saw two daughters married and the third leave home to pursue a career. Wilson's greatest loss, however, was the death of his wife on 6 August 1914. Soon after Ellen Wilson's death, the president met Edith Bolling Galt whom he married on 18 December 1915.\n\n In international relations, Wilson promoted Pan-Americanism and was eager to protect American economic interests. By fostering governments friendly to the United States, he sought to exclude European influence and impose American control in the region. The revolution in Mexico caused Wilson more difficulty than any other foreign policy issue in the Western Hemisphere as he attempted to shape Mexico's politics through peaceful means and military intervention. The larger international relations issue throughout Wilson's early presidency was keeping the United States out of the European war. From the beginning, the Great War had threatened to entangle the United States in Europe despite Wilson's pursuit of neutrality, which he proclaimed on 4 August 1914. Recognizing, however, that the war might threaten U.S. interests, Wilson was anxious to negotiate a compromise peace. He offered U.S. mediation and authorized Edward House, who had been in Europe on the eve of the July 1914 crisis, to continue his efforts to resolve the Anglo-German rivalry; by April 1915 it was obvious that House had failed to achieve any reconciliation between the belligerents. Wilson continued to work with the European nations to search for peace, even as he campaigned for reelection in 1916. Despite Wilson's push for peace, soon after the inauguration of his second term Wilson led the United States into the European conflict. Wilson appointed General John J. Pershing to take charge of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) in Europe, and Congress passed the Selective Service Act giving the federal government the power to draft young men into the U.S. armed forces. On the home front, the president exerted vigorous executive leadership, managing public opinion and mobilizing the economy; wartime measures gave the Wilson administration unprecedented powers over the daily life of Americans.\n\n Wilson outlined his vision of progressive order on 8 January 1918 in the Fourteen Points address to Congress. His plan called for open diplomacy, freedom of navigation and commerce, disarmament, national self-determination, and a postwar League of Nations. In October 1918, facing military defeat, Germany appealed to Wilson for peace on the basis of his Fourteen Points; on this basis, but with reservations, the two sides concluded the armistice on 11 November 1918, ending the war. Wilson participated personally in the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. At the heart of Wilson's peace program was the new League of Nations. He made drafting the covenant for this new international organization his top priority and insisted on its inclusion in the peace treaty. Although the Germans almost universally denounced the peace treaty that their delegation received at Versailles on 7 May 1919, Wilson joined the Allies and compelled Germany to sign the treaty on 28 June 1919. Back at home, the Senate would not approve the treaty without attaching strong reservations, if not amendments, to the ratification resolution. Wilson once more decided to appeal directly to the American people and in September 1919 went on a speaking tour of western states. During the tour, Wilson's health collapsed. On 2 October 1919, back in Washington, he suffered a massive stroke. With Edith Wilson's assistance, and that of his loyal private secretary Joseph P. Tumulty, the president managed to finish his term but could exercise only minimal leadership during the remaining months. Despite Wilson's work, the Senate rejected the treaty on 19 November 1919 and again on 19 March 1920, thereby preventing the United States from joining the League of Nations.\n\n Despite his illness, Wilson had considered running for a third term but his closest associates forced him to abandon this idea. Woodrow and Edith Wilson retired to their home in Washington on 4 March 1921 in relative obscurity. He died at home in Washington on 2 February 1924."}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"MC215_b1","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The Woodrow Wilson Additional Materials consist of materials that the Seeley G.

Martin and Laura Bartlow Martin. Martin knew from a young age that he wanted to write. That passion took him to DePauw University. After graduation, he began to pursue his writing career by working as a stringer and eventually a full-time reporter for the Indianapolis Times. As Martin worked his way through the ranks at the Times, the newspaper's managing editor suggested he write for magazines. Using his early experience on the police headquarters beat, Martin began writing for Official Detective and Actual Detective. In the 1940s, Martin graduated to higher circulation magazines such as Harper's, Saturday Evening Post, Life, Look, Collier's, and The Atlantic. Martin published They Call It North Country, the first of sixteen books in 1944. Martin's 1948 article, \"The Blast in Centralia #5\" in Harper's, established his national reputation.\n\n Early in the 1950s, Martin was asked to edit a book of speeches by Illinois governor Adlai Stevenson. After Stevenson's 1952 Democratic presidential nomination, Martin joined the governor's team of speechwriters. Martin quickly became known for his skill as editorial advance man and his ability to craft the short stump speech. Martin also worked on Stevenson's 1956 presidential campaign, all the while continuing to write and publish as a freelancer.\n\n As a result of his seven-part series in the Saturday Evening Post on the Senate labor racketeering investigation of Jimmy Hoffa and the Teamsters Union, Martin became involved with the 1960 Kennedy campaign. After Kennedy's election, he wrote speeches for the Kennedy administration. One speech, drafted for Newton Minow, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, coined the phrase \"vast wasteland\" referring to the quality of television. Kennedy appointed Martin United States Ambassador to the Dominican Republic, a position he would hold until Kennedy's assassination. Martin went on to work on the presidential campaigns of Lyndon Johnson and Robert Kennedy but retreated from politics after Robert Kennedy's assassination.\n\n Writing had always been Martin's primary interest, so he focused on his experiences in the Dominican Republic: Overtaken by Events (1966) and U.S. Policy in the Caribbean (1978); a two-volume biography: Adlai Stevenson of Illinois: The Life of Adlai E. Stevenson (1976) and Adlai Stevenson and the World: The Life of Adlai E. Stevenson (1977); and his memoirs It Seems Like Only Yesterday: Memoirs of Writing, Presidential Politics, and the Diplomatic Life (1986). In 1964, Martin accepted a series of visiting fellowships at the Institute for Advanced Studies, Wesleyan University; Princeton University; and the City University of New York. From 1970 to 1980 Martin taught journalism at Northwestern University in the Medill School of Journalism.\n\n Martin died on 3 January 1987. In 1988 the Northwestern University Medill School of Journalism established the John Bartlow Martin Award for Public Interest Magazine Journalism.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"MC151_b1","publish":true},{"type":"scopecontent","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The John Bartlow Martin papers on Adlai Stevenson contain transcripts of interviews and Martin's notes used in the preparation of the two volume biography, Adlai Stevenson of Illinois (1976) and Adlai Stevenson and the World (1977).

He was considered a candidate for the Nobel Prize. Musgrave's seminal work, The Theory of Public Finance(1959), theorized the economic role of government in partnership with the private sector in democratic societies. Musgrave conceptualized the public sector budget as having three branches concerned with the allocation of resources, the distribution of income, and stabilization of the economy. Musgrave also introduced the new concept of \"merit wants.\" His work further revolutionized public finance by applying microeconomic analysis, Keynesian macroeconomics and consideration of equity to theories of taxation. Renowned for its accessible style, the book is still considered a major theoretical work in the field of public finance. The Musgraves' co-authored 1973 work Public Finance in Theory and Practicealso remains an important textbook. Musgrave served as an advisor on tax reform to a number of governments, including postwar Germany, Colombia, Bolivia, Puerto Rico, Indonesia, South Korea, and Taiwan. In addition, he served as editor of the Quarterly Journal of Economics and was founder and President of the International Seminar in Public Economics. He was a Fellow of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Science, and was a Distinguished Fellow of the American Economic Association and the National Tax Association as well as Honorary President of the International Institute of Public Finance. He was awarded the Frank E. Seidman Award in Political Economy in 1981.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true}],"publish":true},{"subnotes":[{"content":"Consists of the professional files of Richard A. Musgrave.

Willauer married Louise Russell in June of 1930. They had three children, Sally, Whiting, Jr. and Thomas.\n\n Following law school Willauer worked for the law firm of Bingham, Dana &amp; Gould for seven years practicing admiralty law. In 1939 he accepted a position as Special Attorney with the United States Civil Aeronautics Board where he was put in charge of the conduct of air mail rate hearings and the other matters involving the Washington National Airport. From 1939 through 1940 Willauer worked as an attorney in the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice investigating judicial corruption. While in this position, Willauer also served as a special assistant to the United States Attorney General and conducted the first grand jury investigation into Nazi propaganda. In 1941 Willauer served as Special Counsel for the Federal Power Commission. In this capacity Willauer worked on the proposed St. Lawrence Seaway legislation.\n\n In July 1941 Willauer took a position with China Defense Supplies, Inc. (CDS, Inc.), the official representative of the Chinese government in lend-lease matters. Willauer worked as assistant to T.V. Soong, President of CDS, Inc. It was this job that launched Willauer's career in Asia. While in China Willauer met Claire L. Chennault with whom he founded the American Volunteer Group, also known as the \"Flying Tigers\", and advised Chennault on matters related to this organization.\n\n In 1944 Willauer was assigned a new position as Director, Far East and Special Territories Branch of the Foreign Economic Administration. In 1946 Willauer was an advisor to the director on reconstruction problems in China for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA).\n\n During this time, beginning in 1946, Willauer and Chennault formed the Civil Air Transport (CAT) company. Willauer served as executive vice-president, and later as president and vice-chair of the board. CAT was a civilian airline which transported supplies and individuals throughout China and Asia, often taking risks that other airlines refused to take. During the war in China between the Communists and the Nationalists, CAT aided the Nationalists in transporting supplies to both the army and to civilians. CAT, Inc. was eventually bought by the U.S. government (the C.I.A.) in the late 40s/early 50s. Following a lawsuit between CAT, Inc. and another Chinese airline, Central Air Transport, Corp. (CATC) Willauer left China and returned to the United States.\n\n From 1954 to 1958 Willauer served as United States Ambassador to Honduras, and from 1958 to 1961 he served as United States Ambassador to Costa Rica. During his ambassadorship to Costa Rica, Willauer served as a delegate to the meeting of foreign ministers for the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1960 and as a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly in October 1960. In July 1961 Willauer gave testimony to the United States Senate Internal Security Subcommittee Investigation on the Bay of Pigs incident in Cuba.\n\n Whiting Willauer died at age 56 in 1962.

Rogow (1924-2006) was a political scientist, author, and psychotherapist. His main area of research was psychological explanations for politics, especially the decision-making of leaders, notably James Forrestal and Alexander Hamilton.\n\n Rogow taught at the University of Iowa and Stanford University before becoming a professor of political science at the City College of New York (part of CUNY) in 1966, where he remained for the rest of his career. Soon after coming to New York, Rogow studied at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute and became a practicing psychotherapist in addition to his academic responsibilities. Rogow became a leading figure in the study of the psychodymanics of political behavior and was instrumental in establishing it as a cross-field interdisciplinary concentration at CUNY. He also served as the associate editor of the Journal of Conflict Resolution from 1956 to 1963 and was a member of the original editorial committee of Comparative Politics.\n\n Rogow was a pioneer and prolific writer in the field of psychiatry and politics, and wrote or edited over a dozen books, as well as numerous articles, during his career utilizing his psychoanalytic expertise. His major works include James Forrestal: A Study of Personality, Politics, and Policy (1963), Power, Corruption and Rectitude with Harold D. Laswell (1963), The Psychiatrists (1970), The Dying of the Light: A Searching Look at America Today (1975), Thomas Hobbes: Radical in the Service of Reaction (1986), and A Fatal Friendship: Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr (1998). His book on James Forrestal, the first Secretary of Defense and the nation's highest-ranking individual to later commit suicide, was Rogow's first major work to utilize psychology to examine a political figure. Rogow relied on both the archival record and interviews or correspondence with over fifty individuals who knew Forrestal in various capacities, including some of the psychiatrists involved in treating his illness, to identify the factors which led Forrestal to commit suicide in 1949.\n\n Arnold Austin Rogow was born on August 10, 1924 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He earned his B.A. in political science from the University of Wisconsin in 1947 after interrupting his undergraduate education to serve in the Army as an infantryman during World War II. Rogow earned his Ph.D. in political science from Princeton University in 1953, where he wrote his dissertation on \"The Labor Government and British Industry, 1945-1951.\" He married Patricia Evans and they had three children: Jennifer, Sarah, and Jeanne.

Street (1879-1947) was a novelist and essayist especially noted for his writing and expertise about food and wine. He was also a friend and great admirer of Theodore Roosevelt.\n\n Julian Leonard Street was born on April 18, 1879 in Chicago, Illinois. He graduated from Ridley College, St. Catharines in Ontario, Canada. Street began his writing career with newspaper work at the New York Mail and Express in 1899, and served as the drama editor from 1900 to 1901.\n\n Street was a novelist and essayist, best known for his writings on food and wine. He was awarded the Chevalier's Cross of the Legion of Honor from the French government for his work in popularizing knowledge of French wines and cooking through his writings. Street also wrote novels and fictional articles. His works include Abroad at Home (1914), Mysterious Japan (1921), Rita Coventry (1922), and Where Paris Dines (1929). Other works include Ship-Bored, Paris à la Carte, Sunbeams, Inc., Tides (in collaboration with his wife Ada Street), Wines, and Men, Machines and Morals. He collaborated with novelist Booth Tarkington, a close friend, on the comedy play \"The Ohio Lady\" in 1916 and they rewrote it as \"Country Cousin\" in 1921. Street also wrote an acclaimed article about John Purroy Mitchel during Mitchel's mayoralty campaign for New York City in 1917. In 1926, Street won the O. Henry Memorial Prize for his story \"Mr. Bisbee's Princess,\" a fantasy about a jeweler who meets a princess.\n\n Street became a great admirer and friend of Theodore Roosevelt towards the end of Roosevelt's life. They met several times while Street wrote a study of Roosevelt for Collier's weekly in August and September of 1915, which was published as \"The Most Interesting American.\" Street continued to write articles about Roosevelt, most for Collier's, and supported Roosevelt for the presidential nomination for the Republican Party in 1916. The friendship between the men grew with their continued association, and Street and his family were invited to luncheons and other social visits with the Roosevelts several times from 1915 to 1919. Street also corresponded with Roosevelt about political issues, especially related to President Woodrow Wilson's policies regarding World War I.\n\n Julian Street married Ada Hilt in 1900. They had two children, Julian Street, Jr. and Mrs. C. Hunt Lewis. Ada Street died in 1926, and he married Marguerite Skibeness four years later. Street died on February 19, 1947. At the time of his death, he was writing a movie script."}],"type":"bioghist","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"16316c0f709a2cc4125bb9f80dc0e300","type":"scopecontent","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"content":"Street's papers on Theodore Roosevelt are composed of correspondence, the majority being letters from Roosevelt to Street, as well as copies of articles, clippings, and other related materials which Street collected and prepared for a book of manuscript materials documenting his association with Roosevelt. Also included are Street's title pages for each section and descriptions by Street of most documents that provide explanations of references within the letters and related events.\n\n Initially, the majority of the correspondence is concerned with articles by Street about Roosevelt, including \"The Most Interesting American,\" and also includes copies of those articles. This type of material is found throughout the papers. Beginning in October 1915, other correspondence concerns invitations to Street for social visits with the Roosevelts. Their correspondence also includes frequent mentions about Roosevelt's views on the nation's preparedness for war, the need for the United States to enter World War I, and criticisms of Wilson's policies to stay out of the war. Other subjects of conversation include the Republican National Convention in 1916 and the campaign of John Purroy Mitchel for New York mayor in 1917. Additionally, the papers include correspondence from Edith Roosevelt, typically brief acknowledgements of gifts Street sent them or of visits.\n\n The papers also contain materials related to Roosevelt's death in 1919. These include Street's reflections upon Roosevelt's last days and a memorial article he wrote for Collier's. It also includes several articles written by others who knew Roosevelt about his legacy, and correspondence between Street and political, military, and literary figures about Roosevelt, the leadership of the Republican Party, and contributing materials for this book of manuscripts that Street was compiling.

Founding members included George Field, Dorothy Thompson, Wendell L. Willkie, Herbert Agar, Herbert Bayard Swope, and Rex Stout. These and other members had been involved in both Fight For Freedom and in the New York Chapter of the Committee to Defend America By Aiding the Allies. Freedom House carried on the spirit of these two organizations by acting as a clearing house of information. Its first agenda was to work, during World War II, to prepare the country for peace, and then after the war to continue to defend peace and freedom throughout the world. Throughout the period from 1941 to 1967 George Field was the Executive Director of Freedom House and was in charge of the day-to-day activities as well as the long-range planning for the organization. These records reflect Field's position in Freedom House during this time. The collection contains only the records that George Field retained from Freedom House, not the official records of the organization.

Materials that are more administrative in nature are also present in the form of invitations Aaron received, his schedules and appointments, and his telephone memorandums.\n\n To a lesser extent, the collection includes records related to Aaron's work for Walter F. Mondale, both in his position as Mondale's legislative assistant in the U.S. Senate and as a foreign policy advisor for Mondale's 1984 presidential campaign. There is also a small amount of documentation on Aaron's tenure with Oppenheimer and Company and a number of his speeches and writings that postdate his tenure in the Executive Office, including a typescript of his first novel.

Born in London, Swift was brought to the United States by his parents when he was less than one year old. He graduated from Trinity College in Hartford, CT in 1942, afterwards serving in the Air Force during World War II.\n\n In 1948, Swift earned a bachelor's degree in engineering from Yale University. He spent the next fifty years managing and working as an engineer for various civil engineering, environmental research and energy development projects. Prior to working for the Development and Resources Corporation, Swift was a supervising engineer on several major construction projects in the United States and Canada. He then joined the Development and Resources Corporation and lived in the Khuzestan region of Iran from 1958-1963, serving as the project engineer for the organization's Dez Dam project in the city of Andimeshk. Following his work on the Dez Dam, Swift was responsible for supervising the Development and Resources Corporation's engineering and agricultural projects in Nicaragua, Colombia, Uruguay, Guinea, Iran, Afghanistan, and Vietnam. \n\n In 1970, Swift took a position as vice president of GEOMET, an environmental consulting firm in Rockville, MD. From 1982-1985, he was the manager of foreign affiliates for an American electric power systems firm. Swift was an independent consultant for the rest of his career, though he also served as an energy advisor to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in Pakistan from 1989-1994.\n\n Swift died in Portland, ME at age 90.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"persistent_id":"MC283_b1","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","type":"scopecontent","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"content":"The majority of the collection pertains to Swift's work for the Development and Resources Corporation (D and R).

It was renamed the Work Projects Administration in 1939 as it was consolidated into the Federal Works Agency. Congress ended the program in 1943. The WPA was perhaps the largest component of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal. The WPA was the largest employer in the country at its height. The goal of the Works Progress Administration was to establish and maintain projects benefiting the public good in order to create work for citizens who were unemployed and on relief. Many of the WPA’s projects were related to infrastructure: highways, bridges, buildings, sewers, etc. However, the WPA also employed artists and funded programs that benefited culture and history. One such program was the Federal Writers’ Project. The New Jersey Historical Records Survey was a component of the Federal Writers’ Project. The stated aim of the Historical Records Survey was \"the discovery, preservation, and listing of basic materials for research in the history of the United States.\" Though only operational for short time, this project collected and compiled marriage and death records, court dockets, indices of laws, board meeting minutes, and inventories of archival repositories from throughout New Jersey. In addition, the New Jersey WPA also conducted an analysis of the Agricultural Administration Act under the Historical Records Survey. The analysis included determining how much acreage of farm land was being used and what types of crops were being grown in New Jersey. The historical Records Survey produced reports on the findings. While not directly related to the Historical Records Survey, the New Jersey Indian Site Survey was another project undertaken by the New Jersey WPA. From 1936 through 1941, the New Jersey WPA, in association with the Archeological Society of New Jersey, conducted archeological digs at various sites in New Jersey. The goal was to catalog, document and preserve aspects of American Indian daily life and culture.","publish":true}],"type":"bioghist","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","persistent_id":"MC144_b1","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"1e41a681cbe5d7e91d68632ae3a1881e","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true,"content":"The New Jersey Works Progress Administration Records document the history of several of projects undertaken by the New Jersey WPA.

He married Rosanna Grace Webster in 1930, and they had three children: Andrew Allen, Lora Katherine, and Mary.\n\n Graham was a faculty member in the Department of Politics at Princeton University from 1930 to 1958, serving as department chair from 1946-1949, and again from 1950-1953. From 1942-1945 he served as in various capacities with the U.S. Bureau of the Budget. From 1944-1945 he served as chief of the Division of Administrative Management of Government Organization of the Hoover Commission. In 1948 he served as chair of the Committee on Indian Affairs, a subcommittee of the Hoover Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of Government. Graham also served on the Hoover Commission Task Force on Personnel and Civil Service from 1954-1955.\n\n In 1958 Graham left Princeton to join the Brookings Institution as director of governmental studies, a position he retained until 1968. He then served as executive director of the National Academy of Public Administration from 1968-1972. Graham concluded his career at Nova University in Fort Lauderdale, Florida as professor of public administration, achieving emeritus status in 1985.\n\n Among Graham's books, the most notable include Education for Public Administration (1941), Morality in American Politics (1952), and America's Capacity to Govern (1960).\n\n Graham participated in a number of other federally mandated committees and non-governmental organizations such as the Detroit Bureau of Government Research (1929-1930), the Senate Subcommittee on Ethics in Government (1951), and the Ford Foundation (1956-1957), among others.","publish":true}],"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","type":"bioghist","publish":true},{"subnotes":[{"content":"The bulk of the collection consists of Graham's subject files from his service on the Committee on Indian Affairs in 1948. The committee was convened as a subcommittee of the Hoover Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of Government. According to Graham, unlike the other Hoover Commission subcommittees, the Committee on Indian Affairs was formed later in the tenure of the Commission - almost as an afterthought - and Hoover asked Graham to chair the committee, although Graham had no prior special knowledge of Indian affairs. The subject files document Graham's process of apprising himself of the history and current status of American Indians: their social, economic and cultural conditions. To a lesser extent, the files also document how Graham organized the committee's research into Indian affairs: the committee members' field trips; the major topical areas of inquiry; and the various individuals and organizations from whom the committee solicited information. The files are particularly rich in copies of internal communications within the Bureau of Indian Affairs, including a number of confidential reports on the status of various American Indian tribal groups and summaries of the structure, policies, and activities of the Bureau.\n\n Almost all the material in the files dates from approximately 1945-1948. This was a critical period in federal relations with American Indians, marking, as it did, the beginnings of the federal government's postwar efforts to end its formal obligations to and management of American Indian tribes. The formation of this policy and its implementation, frequently referred to as \"termination,\" is significantly documented in Graham's papers. This policy was to remain in effect until the 1960s, when it was generally assessed a failure.\n\n The remaining papers consist of Graham's notes, drafts, correspondence, and reports as a member of the Social Science Research Council's Committee on Public Administration, the Committee on Organization of Federal Activity in Education, and the Task Force on Personnel and Civil Service.\n\n The Social Science Research Council, a non-governmental organization, was formed in 1923 with a mission to encourage interdisciplinary social science practice within and beyond academia and to foster research for direct policy application of social science research. Much of the Council's activity took place through its many committees. The Committee on Public Administration was active from 1928-1945, and Graham was a member from 1940-1944. Graham's files contain meeting minutes from 1935-1944, however, as he received and retained copies of prior meeting minutes on joining the committee. Topics of concern detailed in these files include public employment, governmental research bureaus, and training for public administration.\n\n Herbert Hoover convened the Citizens Federal Committee on Education in 1946 to investigate federal activity in education. In correspondence with the Seeley G. Mudd Manuscript Library's curatorial staff (included in the files), Graham explained that Hoover was displeased with the committee's findings, which did not call for increased federal activity in education, as Hoover had hoped. The report of the committee, entitled The Organization of Federal Activity in Education, discusses curriculum development, the training of Foreign Service officers, R.O.T.C. programs, education in federal prisons, citizenship education, the education of Indians and natives of Alaska, and veterans' educational facilities.\n\n The Task Force on Personnel and Civil Service, a sub-group of the second Hoover Commission, was principally concerned with training for civil service.

Included is an index of the subject matter contained on each of the thirty-eight tapes in the collection. There are 36 tapes from the Lamson-Baldwin interviews and two other cassette tapes recorded by Baldwin and later given to Lamson.\n\n The background material includes correspondence between Lamson and her various sources for the book, including Baldwin. These detail the progression of the writing process and the dialogue between Lamson and Baldwin. Notes to Baldwin's secretaries and lawyers, as well as to his friends and family, document Lamson's additional research. There are also copies of Baldwin's personal correspondence prior to 1973. These include letters with collegues, his aunt, and his first wife, Madeline Doty.\n\n The collection also contains a series of memoranda composed by Baldwin discussing his work, his personal life, and his beliefs. These were written exclusively for Lamson and describe everything from his opinions on racism to his feelings about various love affairs. A number of these memoranda are devoted to reminiscences on specific collegues and friends. There are also newspaper and magazine articles pertaining to Baldwin as a public figure at several stages during his career and copies of miscellaneous documents. This latter category includes several Harvard class reports, poetry written by Baldwin while he was in prison, and a few official documents, for example a statement by ACLU board members in response to Baldwin's prosecution in 1923."}],"type":"scopecontent","persistent_id":"f8699d262f068828100b1822aca94f02","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","rights_restriction":{"local_access_restriction_type":[]},"subnotes":[{"content":"LINKED DIGITAL CONTENT NOTE: Please note that some previously linked digital content is temporarily unavailable while the data is being migrated from an outdated access service.

The PCF had developed an extremely successful billboard campaign using the 1949 drawing of Pablo Picasso's peace dove, which he created for the PCF's World Committee of Peace Partisans' conference held in Paris in the spring of 1949. The success of this poster in particular spurred David, with the support of Premier René Pleven, to organize a semi-private, anti-Communist agency. This agency published and distributed posters supplemented by newsletters, brochures, pamphlets, stickers, and tracts that used the words, themes and symbols of the Communist Party to counter their message. In fact, the Paix et Liberté poster titled \"The Dove that Goes Bang\" redesigned Picasso's peace dove adorning the dove with a tank-turret for a head and a cannon for a beak. The posters also criticized several important figures within the PCF including Maurice Thorez, head of the PCF from 1930-1964, a minister of state under de Gaulle in 1945 and deputy premier in 1947 and Jacques Duclos and Marcel Cachin, both party members.

Hard received his preliminary education at the Philander Smith Institute, Mussoorie, India and in public school in Lima, New York and at University College, London, England before enrolling at Northwestern University. After receiving a B.A. in history in 1900, he received a fellowship at Northwestern and lectured there in medieval history.\n\n In 1901, Hard moved to the Northwestern University Settlement House. His professional journalism career began in 1902 with Hard's involvement in the production of Settlement House's monthly newsletter. Like many of his colleagues, Hard developed sympathies for the plight of urban workers and ties to the organized labor movement. He was widely acknowledged among his colleagues for the quality of journalistic integrity which characterized Hard's work. In 1906 he worked as a free-lance contributor to many magazines, an activity in which he continued until the end of his life. He was a member of the editorial staffs of Everybody's and Metropolitan magazines; the latter then edited by Theodore Roosevelt.\n\n With the advent of radio, a new career path for Hard opened up. By 1929 he was a regular correspondent and commentator for the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC). Between 1930-1935, Hard broadcast reports and interviews from Washington, D.C., the 1932 Republican Convention in Chicago, and Berlin. In February 1937, he was appointed executive assistant to the Chairman of the Republican National Committee and served as secretary of the Republican Program Committee. He resigned his party posts in October 1938, saying he wished to return to \"independent political journalism.\" In the following year, he began writing for Reader's Digest and was roving editor for the magazine until his death in New Caanan, Connecticut in 1962.\n\n He was married in Chicago, November 3, 1903 to Anne Nyhan, adopted daughter of Wiley S.

She was born in Gainesville, Georgia on August 28, 1887, the second daughter of Woodrow and Ellen Axson Wilson. She was educated privately in Princeton and at the Woman's College of Baltimore (later Goucher College); after her graduation, she worked at a settlement home in Philadelphia for three years. She was also involved with the YWCA, serving on its national board. She married Francis Bowes Sayre (a Harvard professor, Ambassador to Siam, Assistant Secretary of State for Franklin Rooselvelt and U. S. High Commissioner for the Philippines) on November 25, 1913 at the White House and had three children with him, Francis Bowes Sayre, Jr., Eleanor Axson Sayre, and Woodrow Wilson Sayre. After World War I, the Sayres moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts where Sayre worked in the interests of the Democratic Party, the League of Nations, and the League of Women Voters. In 1928 Sayre made the introductory speech for presidential nominee Alfred Smith at the Democratic National Convention and in 1929 her name was mentioned as a candidate for the Democratic nomination for United States Senator; she declined. After that time, she continued to participate actively as a party official in Massachusetts. Sayre died after an emergency appendectomy operation on January 15, 1933, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"MC216_b1","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","type":"scopecontent","subnotes":[{"content":"The Jessie Wilson Sayre Collection documents the close relationships amongst the Wilson and Axson families in the early twentieth century and provides details into their lives.

As an economist, he was a member of the Economists' National Committee on Monetary Policy, the National Monetary Association, and the Stable Money Association. He also held positions at American Car &amp; Foundry.\n\n Rovensky was born in 1880 near New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, Canada to a recently immigrated Austro-Hungarian glassmaker. In 1885, the family moved to Allegheny, Pennsylvania and again to Jeanette, Pennsylvania in 1893. Rovensky dropped out of high school at age 16, after contracting tuberculosis. Rovensky married Madjesia Ewing in 1904. They were separated in 1935 and divorced in 1947. He was married again in 1954, to socialite Mrs. Maisie Cadwell Manwaring Plant Hayward, who died in 1956.\n\n Rovensky's first job was as an errand boy at the First National Bank of Pittsburgh in 1900. He was steadily promoted, eventually becoming assistant cashier. During this period, Rovensky studied at the American Institute of Banking. The Institute gave young men the opportunity to study economics, business, business law, and accounting with professors from the University of Western Pennsylvania (now University of Pittsburgh). Rovensky eventually become president of the Pittsburgh chapter of the Institute. In June of 1913, the Pittsburgh branch of the First National Bank temporarily closed and, within a day, Rovensky opened a bank nearby to handle the bank's customers during the hiatus.\n\n Rovensky was hired in early 1914 as assistant cashier in charge of foreign trade at the prestigious National Bank of Commerce in New York City. Here he created one of the first dollar banker's acceptance import credit under the new Federal Reserve Act at the onset of World War I. Within two years, Rovensky became the vice president, which made him the youngest vice president of a New York bank at age 35. In 1926, Rovensky was a candidate for president of the bank. Stevenson Ward was given the job however, and Rovensky, dissatisfied with Ward’s leadership, moved to Bank of America. He was later appointed vice chairman of that firm. In 1931, National City Bank absorbed Bank of America, but Rovensky, unlike his Bank of America colleagues, retained his position as vice chairman.\n\n From 1920 to 1933, Rovensky played a major role in three associations which advocated monetary stabilization: the Economists' National Committee on Monetary Policy, the National Monetary Association, and the Stable Money Association. He was president of the Stable Money Association in 1927.\n\n In 1944, faced with compulsory retirement at National City Bank, Rovensky became chairman of the executive committee of the American Car and Foundry. He had served on the board of directors since 1940. In 1951, he became chairman of the board. At the behest of his fiancée, Maisie Cadwell, he retired in 1954 and spent the remaining years of his life in Newport, Rhode Island, Manhattan, and Palm Springs. Rovensky died February 18, 1970.\n\n For additional information on the life of John E. Rovensky, see the biography written by Donald L. Kemmerer: The Life of John E.

He entered Princeton University in 1917 and returned there in 1921, after serving in the U.S. Navy. After obtaining his BA in 1921 and an MA in history in 1922 he decided to pursue a career in the diplomatic service. He attended the Ecole des Science Politiques in Paris, France in the following year, and passed his diplomatic examinations in 1923, entering the diplomatic service in 1924. In the following year, during his first assignment as 3rd Secretary of the Legation in Budapest (1924-1926), he married Elizabeth \"Frisk\" Luke of Tarrytown, New York, whom he had met prior to his departure. Matthews was transferred to Bogota, Colombia, in 1926, and to the State Department in 1930, where he became Assistant Chief of the Latin American Division (1930-1933). His son Harrison Freeman Matthews Jr. (\"Free\") was born in Bogota in 1929, followed by Thomas Luke (\"Tim\") in 1933.\n\n Matthews was appointed 1st Secretary of the Embassy in Havana, Cuba (1933-1937), where he joined Ambassador Jefferson Caffery, under whom he had already served in Columbia in 1928-1930. He was transferred to Paris, France as First Secretary in 1937. After a brief interlude in Spain in 1939, where he served as the first US representative to the Franco government after the Civil War, he stayed in Paris until June 10, 1940, when Italy declared war on France, a week after the capital had been bombarded by Germany. After the resignation of the Reynaud government and the signing of the armistice with Germany and Italy, Matthews spent the following two years in Vichy, where the French regime under Marshal Pétain was based. Matthews' wife and children had stayed in the United States since 1939, but Frisk Matthews visited her husband in Vichy between late November 1940 and May, 1941. After Pearl Harbor Matthews was transferred to London as counselor and minister under Ambassador John Winant (1941). Because of his knowledge of France, he was designated as political advisor to General Eisenhower in the summer of 1942, and was with him during the landings in Gibraltar in November 1942. In the autumn of 1943 Matthews reunited with his family in Washington, where he served for the next four years, first as Chief, then Director of the Office of European Affairs. During this time he attended the Yalta and Potsdam Conferences (1945), the Paris Peace Treaty negotiations (1946) and the Moscow Conference with General George Marshall (1947).\n\n Matthews served as Ambassador to Sweden from 1947 to 1950. Two days before the Korean War broke out, he was appointed Deputy Under Secretary of State, serving under Dean Acheson (1950-1953). In 1955, during his subsequent appointment as ambassador to the Netherlands (1953-1957), his wife Frisk died of a brain tumor. In 1957, Matthews remarried Mrs. Helen Skouland, a secretary he had worked with during the war. He spent his last years of diplomatic service with her as ambassador in Vienna from 1957 until 1962, when he retired and returned to Washington. He served as a member of the Board of National Estimates at the CIA from 1963 to 1969 and as the American Chairman of the American-Canadian Permanent Joint Board on Defense from 1963 to 1969. A widower again in 1966, he married Mrs. Elizabeth Bluntschli in 1967, the widow of an old friend. Matthews died at 87 in 1986."}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"MC243_b1","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The H.

The committee, consisting of New Jersey-based political science professors and lawyers, fully supported the Supreme Court’s decision. Co-chaired by Princeton professor Alpheus T. Mason and Newark lawyer Joseph Harrison, the committee met throughout the last six months of 1964 with the purpose of drafting a report consisting of recommendations for implementing the Supreme Court’s decision. Their final draft, Reapportionment in New Jersey: Recommendations and Supporting Statements, was finished in 1965 and submitted to the Legislative Reapportionment and Congressional Redistricting Commission. Among the committee’s recommendations were the retention of a bicameral legislature, the use of population for the drawing of districts, enlarging the state senate to 30 members, and the re-drawing of districts with an eye toward growth trends. The committee opposed systems of weighted or fractional voting and the tying together of state legislative and congressional districts.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"type":"bioghist","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","type":"scopecontent","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true,"content":"The New Jersey Fair Representation Committee Records document the committee’s history through correspondence, reports and miscellaneous files.

Page and Helen White Hamilton. When he was eight the family moved to Ardmore, PA, where his father became president of Autocar Company, a leading manufacturing company for commercial trucks. Page graduated from the Haverford School in Haverford, PA in 1937 and enrolled at Princeton University as a member of the Class of 1941.\n\n At Princeton, Page majored in modern languages. He was drawn, however, to sports rather than academics, and his enjoyment of other aspects of student life at Princeton sometimes landed him in trouble. In his obituary in the Princeton Alumni Weekly, classmates described him as \"a boy so alive, so full of charm\" and \"fond of games and clean fun.\" He was an all-around athlete, and particularly excelled at golf: Page was the first to captain the Princeton golf team for two years and was elected president of the Intercollegiate Golf Association during his senior year.\n\n According to a note in his student records, Page was unsure about his vocation throughout his years at Princeton, but considered a career in banking or manufacturing after graduation. However, he joined the Naval Air Corps in the early fall of 1941, several months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that caused many other young Americans to enlist.\n\n During his preliminary flight training at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, Page was chosen leader of his class of student pilots. He met Pearman (née Aiguier) during a party on Christmas night, December 25, 1941, less than a month before she turned seventeen. Pearman was a high school senior at the Baldwin School, an independent college prep day school in the Philadelphia suburb of Bryn Mawr, who lived with her family at home in Cynwyd, PA.\n\n After finishing his preliminary flight training in Philadelphia, Page received subsequent training as a Naval reservist and aviation cadet at bases in New Orleans and at Pensacola, the primary training base for Navy and Marine aviators. According to Marine Corps records, Page received his commission seven months later, on September 1, 1942 in Miami, Florida, with the rank of 2nd lieutenant. He was first assigned to a Marine dive-bombing squadron, but while awaiting further training at San Diego, the squadron was re-assigned to torpedo bombing, the 'most dangerous phase of aerial warfare,' according to his obituary in the Princeton Alumni Weekly.\n\n Page's squadron was ordered to the Southwest Pacific, where combined Allied forces were involved in their first major offensive against imperial Japanese forces on the ground, at sea, and in the air, on and around the island of Guadalcanal in the southern Solomon Islands. According to a letter from Page's mother, present in his alumni file, the squadron landed in the New Hebrides on January 14, 1943. This was only days after the Guadalcanal Campaign ended, resulting in the first significant strategic combined arms victory by the Allied over the Japanese forces in the Pacific.\n\n Tragically, Page lost his life near the island of Efate during a tropical storm on the night of February 14, while he was flying his 303rd hour. In a letter to his parents earlier that day he had written: \"There is a flight planned for tonight. This should be great fun if the storm holds off.\" All planes ordered to Guadalcanal that night were lost.\n\n Sixty-four years later Pearman describes herself as a young girl who had no idea at the time of what the war entailed, but whose life changed dramatically after Page's death. She accelerated her studies at Vassar, where she had started in September 1942, in order to graduate early and join the WAVES (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service). This was a division of the U.S. Navy, established in August 1942, for women only with the provision that they could not continue their Navy careers once the war had ended. When Pearman graduated from Vassar, however, the Second World War had just come to an end."}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"MC211_b1","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The Peter M.

Many of the letters are in appreciation of his service, hospitality and friendship sent by State Department figures and visiting dignitaries. (One typical note, addressed to Mrs. Beam, sends thanks for efforts and gifts bestowed, reading: \"Our first American hose and toilet articles were especially appreciated.\") Other correspondence includes official certifications and instructions. The later letters are denser, as Beam responds to researchers' queries with memories and analysis of Nazi Germany, the arms race, Communism, and other issues.\n\n The Ambassador saved scores of newspaper clippings about himself, which trace his global movements; most express praise for his efforts and approval of his assignments. There is a separate file for clippings from Czech, Russian and German language papers, also pertaining to Beam's work.\n\n The collection contains several reports written by Beam, plus related drafts, notes and correspondence. One study submitted to the League of Nations delegation discusses the \"question of the Saar,\" a former French territory which France demanded from Germany as war reparation. Beam's research into the internal policies of the Nazis in prewar Germany, as well as later articles and speeches, are preserved in the collection.\n\n Two boxes of photographs show Beam conducting the formalities of his office: plane disembarkments; embassy functions; conferences in Germany, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and Poland; State Department gatherings, and presidential visits. There are several shots of Beam meeting with Nixon and Henry Kissinger in the Oval Office, and others of Beam with the Nixons and Johnsons in less exclusive settings. The collection contains a few pictures of Beam in Cambridge and of his father at Princeton. Most were taken by official photographers, though some seem to be snapshots taken by Beam, including one of a Nazi rally in prewar Berlin. There is also a film of his arrival in Warsaw.\n\n The \"Invitations and Ids\" file contains the dozens of souvenir receipts Beam kept from important dinner parties, receptions and conferences, as well as his passports and photo passes. Many of the paper slips are from the League of Nations, the International Military Tribunal, and the United Nations. Others are from events in prewar Germany. In addition to these ticket stubs, Beam collected Nazi memorabilia, such as Hitler postcards and stamps, swastika medallions, and Hitler's signature, as well as articles from other foreign posts and the United States, including an encased Nixon signature paperweight, a dog's certificate in Czech, papers from the London Zoo acknowledging his temporary adoption of the zoo's \"Social Vulture,\" and a silver certificate inscribed, \"Short Snorter Jake.\""}],"persistent_id":"4490bc90d438eefd9469cdb9b24624a4","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","persistent_id":"ce78c5e3cffcf971e9c87b2520a6d158","type":"arrangement","subnotes":[{"content":"The collection contains correspondence, reports and articles by Beam, newspaper clippings, invitations and ticket stubs, photographs, a film, and assorted memorabilia, arranged in that order.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"publish":true},{"type":"accessrestrict","persistent_id":"5d1497af9a20ebaa59fa092bbf675bec","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","rights_restriction":{"local_access_restriction_type":[]},"subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true,"content":"Collection is open for research use."}],"publish":true},{"persistent_id":"63d260ed5b2b8997df0cd300d3ba1a04","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"Single photocopies may be made for research purposes.

He was admitted to the New York Bar in 1948 and joined the law firm of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &amp; Hamilton, where he later became partner. In 1951 Shea married Felice Klau, a fellow attorney with whom he had three children: Steven, Katherine and Andrew.\n\n A pioneer in the Democratic reform movement, he founded the Lexington Democratic Club in 1949, an insurgent organization designed as a protest against the regular or recognized political club within the Ninth Assembly District in Manhattan. His liberal viewpoint attracted him to Adlai Stevenson's presidential campaign in 1952. He was asked to join several other active volunteers from the 1952 campaign to organize the 1956 Stevenson for President Committee (New York State). Shea served as executive chairman and later founded the National Committee to Draft Stevenson in 1960.\n\n Through out his life, Shea remained active in the Democratic party and liberal causes serving as a member of the New York State Democratic Committee, 1958-1975; delegate to the New York State Democratic Convention, 1954-1968; co-chairman of the New York State Citizens for McCarthy, 1968; Justice Department hearing officer for conscientious objectors, 1961-1968; trustee and executive vice chairman of the Eleanor Roosevelt Foundation; 1965-1972; and as a board member of the National Committee for an Effective Congress.

The family name, MacVeagh, stands out in the history of American statecraft. His father, Charles, was President Calvin Coolidge's Ambassador to Japan; his grandfather, Wayne MacVeagh, was Attorney General in President James A. Garfield's Cabinet and his great-uncle, Franklin MacVeagh, was President William Howard Taft's Secretary of the Treasury. MacVeagh graduated from the Groton School in 1909 and Harvard, magna cum laude, in 1913. He studied languages at the Sorbonne in 1913-14 and was fluent in German, French, Spanish, Latin and Classical Greek.\n\n MacVeagh married Margaret Charlton Lewis, the daughter of a distinguished linguist, on August 17, 1917. She was a serious student of classical languages. Their daughter, Margaret Ewen MacVeagh, accompanied her parents on various tours of duty. Mrs. MacVeagh died on September 9, 1947. In May 1955, MacVeagh remarried Mrs. Virginia Ferrante Coats, daughter of Marchese and Marchesa Ferrante di Ruffano of Naples, Italy.\n\n A member of the American Expeditionary Force in World War I, Major MacVeagh served in the Artois, St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne campaigns and was cited by General of the Armies John J. Pershing in 1919 for \"exceptionally meritorious services.\" After World War I, he became a director of the Henry Holt Company, a publishing firm, which he left in 1923 to found the Dial Press.\n\n In 1933, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed MacVeagh Minister to Greece, he followed presentation of his credentials with a speech in classical Greek. After leaving Athens in June 1941, several months after the German Army overran Greece, MacVeagh was appointed the first United States Minister to Iceland. In 1942, he became Minister to the Union of South Africa and successfully coordinated the American wartime agencies there. In 1943, he was sent to Cairo as Ambassador to the exiled Greek and Yugoslav Governments, then returned to liberated Athens as Ambassador in 1944. His secret testimony on the danger of Soviet-supported extreme leftist movements in the Balkans before Congress in 1947 was considered an important factor in formulating what became known as the Truman Doctrine, and he urged the post-war Greek Government to pursue a democratic policy. In 1948, he was named Ambassador to Portugal, and he helped to obtain its admittance into the Atlantic Pact groups of nations. In 1952, President Harry S. Truman named him Ambassador to Spain.\n\n MacVeagh conducted excavations beneath the Acropolis and made archaeological contributions to the National Museum in Athens. With his first wife, he wrote Greek Journey, a book for children.\n\n He retired in 1953 as envoy in Madrid after having conducted successful negotiations for military and economic agreements between the United States and Spain. MacVeagh died on January 15, 1972, at a nursing home in Adelphi, Maryland at the age of 81. He was survived by his wife and daughter, Margaret (Mrs. Samuel E. Torne) of Cambridge, Massachusetts.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"type":"bioghist","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"eeb956eba9f876ec9f49e66ca0e92d37","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"content":"Consists of papers of MacVeagh relating to his diplomatic career as minister to Greece (1933-1942), ambassador to the exiled Greek and Yugoslav governments in Cairo (1943-1944), and returning ambassador to Greece (1944-1947).

Hirschman (1915- ) was a leading scholar in the field of economic development whose work focused on Latin America but encompassed the globe. He was a professor at Yale, Columbia, Harvard, and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. His work made important contributions to economics, the history of ideas, and the social sciences, and also provided insight into discussions of the economic reasons for changes in Latin American governments from the 1960s to the 1980s.\n\n Albert Otto Hirschman was born in Berlin, Germany on April 7, 1915 to Carl and Hedwig Hirschmann. He lived and studied in Berlin, including at the University of Berlin from 1932 to 1933, until he moved to France in 1933. He studied at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales and Institut de Statistique, Sorbonne in Paris from 1933 to 1935, where he earned diplomas. He then studied at the London School of Economics from 1935 to 1936 as an International Student Service Fellow. He attended the University of Trieste from 1936 to 1938, where he earned his doctorate in economics in 1938. Hirschman was an economist at the Institut de Recherches Economiques et Sociales and Institut International de Cooperation Intellectuelle in Paris from 1938 to 1939.\n\n While completing his education, Hirschman became increasingly involved in the fight against fascism in Europe. He fought in the French Army against Nazi occupation in 1940 and in 1941 emigrated to the United States, where he would become a naturalized citizen, to avoid arrest. Hirschman married Sarah Chapiro on June 22, 1941 and they had two daughters, Catherine Jane and Elisabeth Nicole. In the United States, Hirschman was a Rockefeller fellow in international economics at the University of California, Berkeley from 1941 to 1943 before joining the United States Army. He served in the Army from 1943 to 1945, and then served as economist for the Federal Reserve Board from 1946 to 1952.\n\n Hirschman next traveled to Colombia to serve as financial advisor to the National Planning Board of Colombia from 1952 to 1954, and then worked as a private economic advisor with George Kalmanoff in Bogotá, Colombia from 1954 to 1956. Hirschman returned to the United States in 1956, accepting a position at Yale as Irving Fisher Research Professor from 1956 to 1957 and continuing as a visiting research professor of economics until 1958. He was also a consultant for the Rockefeller Foundation from 1957 to 1958. He moved to Columbia University in 1958, where he was professor of international economic relations until 1964. During this time, he was also director of the Latin America Project of the Twentieth Century Fund from 1960 to 1963 and a member of the Board of Editors of the American Economic Review from 1961 to 1964.\n\n Hirschman spent the next ten years of his academic career at Harvard University, where he was professor of political economy from 1964 to 1967 and the Lucius N. Littauer Professor of Political Economy from 1967 to 1974. He was also a Ford Foundation Faculty Research Fellow from 1964 to 1965 and a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavior Sciences in Stanford, California from 1968 to 1969. In addition, he was the study director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institute from 1964 to 1966 and chairman of the SSRC-ACLS Joint Committee on Latin American Studies from 1973 to 1976.\n\n Hirschman's last career move was to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He was a visiting member from 1972 to 1973, and in 1974 accepted a position as a professor in the School of Social Science at the Institute. Hirschman transferred to emeritus status in 1985, a position he still retained as of May 2007. While at the Institute, he was also active in other pursuits, serving as a consultant and as a member of several executive committees. Hirschman was also a fellow at Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin from 1990 to 1991 and visiting fellow there from 1991 to 1994 and in 2000. In honor of his achievements, the Institute for Advanced Study established the Albert O. Hirschman Chair in Economics on May 1, 2000.\n\n During his career, Hirschman authored numerous books and articles, which have been translated into many languages. Among his important works are The Strategy of Economic Development (1958), Exit, Voice and Loyalty (1970), A Bias for Hope: Essays on Development and Latin America (1971), The Passions and the Interests (1977), and Shifting Involvements: Private Interest and Public Action (1982). The Strategy of Economic Development outlines the beginnings of Hirschman's economic development theories, which challenged the uniform doctrinal prescriptions of the time and advocated for considering each case individually, offering economic development strategies that worked with the local resources and structures.\n\n Hirschman was the recipient of numerous awards and honors from institutions worldwide for his scholarly accomplishments. He received nineteen honorary degrees and was awarded the Order of San Carlos from the government of Colombia in 1995 and the Order of the Southern Cross from the Presidency of Brazil in 2000. For his contributions to political economy and social science, he was awarded the Frank E. Seidman award in 1980, the Talcott Parsons prize from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1983, and the Thomas Jefferson Medal from the American Philosophical Society and the Toynbee prize in 1998. In 2003, he won the Benjamin E. Lippincott Award from the American Political Science Association for The Passions and The Interests, an award given for a work by a political theorist that is still significant at least fifteen years after its publication. Hirschman was also a member of several learned societies, including the Academy of Sciences Berlin-Brandenburg, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Economic Association (fellow), the American Philosophical Society, the Berliner Wissenschaftlich Gesellschaft (Scientific Society of Berlin), the Council on Foreign Relations, the National Academy of Sciences, the British Academy (corresponding fellow), and the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei (foreign member).","jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"MC160_b1","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"827c669c486e57947d5da0aba4840ddf","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"Hirschman's papers document his scholarship on economic development and his academic career and include his correspondence written while he was at the Institute for Advanced Study, his writings, and his research notes and materials, especially related to his work in Latin America and for the World Bank.

The Section serves the university community, industry, and the government and includes a research program, a special library, and aids in instruction at Princeton University. Directors of the Section have included J. Douglas Brown and Frederick H. Harbison.\n\n The Section was the first university research division to specialize in industrial relations and was established to enhance and extend the knowledge in industrial relations in the broadest sense of that term. The Section studies topics such as personnel administration, labor relations, trade union organization and policies, labor and social security legislation, and all aspects of labor economics. It was initiated at the suggestion of Clarence J. Hicks, executive assistant to the president of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and a long-time leader in the field of industrial relations. Hicks persuaded John D. Rockefeller, Jr. to finance the Section for a trial period.\n\n The Section has three principle functions: it serves as a research bureau, with staff conducting and publishing original research, maintains a special reference library on industrial relations, and provides instruction to Princeton University students. The Section acts as a clearing house of information for industry, government agencies, and scholars through the library's resources, distribution of its research materials, holding conferences, and providing consulting services to government and industry. The Section is closely integrated with Princeton University but serves all persons concerned with industrial relations problems.\n\n The Section has published numerous reports, books, articles, and bibliographies on the field of industrial relations resulting from its research. The reports are typically concise, analytical studies of current practices and on subjects of current interest to be immediately useful to individuals involved in determining policies. The subjects of the research are determined in part by inquiries received by the Section. The Section also studies newer trends or practices while they are in the early stages of development. Initially, many of the studies focused on new programs such as benefits and employee stock ownership plans. During the Depression, the Section shifted to studies of problems associated with unemployment and social insurance, as well as the rise of unions. During World War II, the Section made a special effort to publish materials that would aid industry in adjusting to the problems of mobilization. Immediately after World War II, in response to strikes and labor disputes, the Section began to study union-management relations and the factors that contributed to constructive labor relations. The Section expanded its research into three major areas during the 1950s and 1960s: the relationship between management development and economic growth in the United States, the problems encountered by American companies operating abroad and the comparative study of managerial approaches to labor problems internationally. During the 1970s, the Section again expanded its research to include studies of education, discrimination and human capital.\n\n The Section's library is the oldest special library in its field. It collects published and unpublished materials related to the field of industrial relations. An emphasis is placed on collecting current documents and manuscript materials related to developments in the field of industrial relations in the United States and internationally. The Section also aids in the instruction of both undergraduate and graduate students at Princeton University. Students utilize its research findings, the resources of the library, and the industry contacts of the Section to prepare papers, presentations, and senior theses or doctoral dissertations. And the Section has also provided a consulting service, offering advice to government agencies based on its research findings and through participation on committees or conducting specialized studies, as well as providing advice to other universities establishing similar industrial relations sections, and to companies and trade unions.\n\n The first director of the Section, Robert F. Foerster, served from 1922 to 1926. During Foerster's tenure, the essential function of the Section, the enhancement and extension of knowledge in industrial relations, was agreed upon by both Princeton University and Rockefeller. Numerous companies began contributing information and material to the Section, which built up a valuable collection of primary source materials for its library, and the first publication of the Section, Employee Stock Ownership in the United States, was well received. Foerster was succeeded in 1926 by J. Douglas Brown, Dean of the Faculty at Princeton University, who served in both positions simultaneously. Brown was influential in building the Section and solidifying its goals and purpose. He remained director until 1955. Frederick H. Harbison served as director from 1955 to 1968. Since that time, the position has been held by many individuals, including Albert Rees, Orley Ashenfelter, Daniel Hamermesh, Alan B. Krueger and Cecilia E. Rouse and David S. Lee. Lee was named Provost of Princeton University effective July 1, 2013 and was succeded as director by Henry Farber.\n\n In 1927, the Section received funding from John D. Rockefeller, Jr. for three additional years, and in 1930, on the recommendation of Hicks, Rockefeller gave $300,000 for a permanent endowment for the Section. The endowment was supplemented by two gifts of $60,000 each from John D. Rockefeller, III. The Section undertook a fundraising campaign, the \"Twenty-fifth Anniversary Fund,\" in 1944 to raise an additional $360,000 from industry to double the endowment, which was oversubscribed by more than sixty companies and national unions. In 1946, the Section moved into new quarters in the recently completed Harvey S. Firestone Memorial Library through a gift of the Princeton University Class of 1926. By 1955, the endowment was valued at over $1 million, and by 2006 the endowment had grown to over $10 million.\n\n Beginning in 1931, the Section sponsored an annual conference on industrial relations, attended by leading executives in industry and business from the companies that cooperated with the Section. The conference was highly regarded, regularly receiving more applicants than could be accommodated. The conference provided an opportunity for the leaders in the field to discuss the fundamental problems affecting industry. Starting in 1938, the conference was preceded by a seminar course in industrial relations to train junior industrial relations executives. The conference and seminar were discontinued in 1962. The Section also held a similar seminar training course for personnel of national trade unions and federations from 1947 through the 1950s, where they studied basic problems related to collective bargaining and labor legislation.\n\n From 2008 to 2013, the Section remained active at Princeton University. Recent research interests of the Section include aspects of unemployment and racial discrimination, the economics of labor supply and retirement, education and school quality, the effects on minimum wages and labor turnover and job duration.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"content":"The Section's records document the research and administration of the Section and include financial papers and materials related to its conferences, publications, and research.

Born in Kansas on April 27, 1887 and raised in Missouri, Moore attended but did not graduate from Harvard (he is considered a member of the Class of 1907). At the age of 21 Moore, and his brother-in-law went to New York City to promote the idea of a sanitary paper drinking cup to replace the \"common cup\" that could be found in train stations, hospitals, and other public venues. Encountering much initial skepticism, Moore and his brother-in-law soon won over a group of investors by writing letters on Waldorf-Astoria Hotel stationery. With the help of W. T. Graham, President of the American Can Co., and other investors, Moore and his brother-in-law founded the Dixie Cup Corporation. In 1957 he sold Dixie Cup to the American Can Company, and began to devote his efforts entirely to the causes of world population and world peace, in which he had already taken a great deal of interest. He continued to be active in directing the work of the Hugh Moore Fund until his death in 1972.\n\n Moore established The Hugh Moore Fund in 1944 with the specific goal of promoting world peace. His conception of world peace was broad, as can be seen from the materials in this collection relating to the United Nations and NATO on international, national and local levels. However, Moore's most important contribution to the understanding of the concept of world peace was his insistence that population be an element of the definition of world peace, and that it be a factor in issues relating to international relations. An overpopulated, underfed, and undereducated world was a world in which peace could not exist, at least not equally for all, he believed. Moore has consistently been characterized as ahead of his time in this matter. His pamphlet, The Population Bomb, published in the early 1950s, dealt with \"population control\" issues that were considered taboo at the time, and coined the phrase \"population explosion\" as a warning that the world would \"breed itself to death.\" Birth control, for example, was not a topic spoken of nor acknowledged by the general public, neither was euthanasia. However, Moore was deeply concerned about both of these issues, and continued to address them despite a great deal of opposition voiced by many experts in the field of population studies. John D. Rockefeller III, chair of The Population Council considered Moore's publication of The Population Bomb a mistake and thought that it would create general panic."}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"MC153_b1","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"d5975548308b961f8be456acf61197b6","subnotes":[{"content":"Consists of correspondence, memoranda, articles, speeches, photographs, and posters belonging to Moore, relating to his interest in the areas of world peace and world population.

His successful business career was largely spent at Loeb, Rhoades &amp; Company, and he was also frequently called upon to speak about international finance subjects.\n\n Hans Adolf Karl Widenmann was born on December 15, 1897 in Hamburg, Germany to Adolf and Augusta Widenmann. In 1914, soon after the family relocated to the United States, Widenmann enrolled at Princeton University. He graduated with honors in economics in 1918. He earned his M.A. from Columbia University in 1919 and his M.Sc. from Columbia in 1920. Widenmann married Dorothy Hicks on April 2, 1927. They had a son Robert, who died during infancy, and a daughter Elizabeth Alice. Dorothy Hicks Widenmann died in 1949.\n\n From 1919 to 1920, Widenmann was a member of the staff of the Division of Research and Statistics of the Federal Reserve Board in New York City. He then began his career on Wall Street, working for the Columbia Trust Company in the foreign department from 1920 to 1922 and in Europe from 1922 to 1923. In 1924, while still in Europe, Widenmann assisted Dr. Edwin W. Kemmerer, under whom he had studied economics at Princeton University, in developing the Dawes Plan in Berlin.\n\n Widenmann returned to the United States in 1924, working again for a short time on the staff of the Division of Research and Statistics of the Federal Reserve Board, this time in Washington, D.C. He then returned to Wall Street for the duration of his career. From 1925 to 1930, he was an executive at the firm of Ludwig Bendix, an international banking and investment firm. In 1931, Widenmann joined the staff of Carl M. Loeb &amp; Company, a brokerage firm. The firm later became Carl M. Loeb, Rhoades &amp; Company, and then Loeb, Rhoades &amp; Company.

The Committee was managed by the Federal Reserve. Campaigns to promote the sale of the bonds were conducted by Federal Reserve District and emphasized the patriotic duty of citizens to aid the war effort through the purchase of the bonds.\n\n United States entry into World War I necessitated a huge increase in government spending, both for the U.S. military and in aid for the Allies. One of the main fundraising efforts for the government were four Liberty Loans and a fifth Victory Loan, which sold U.S. Treasury bonds to the American public. The sale of the loans were managed by the Federal Reserve, which had been established only a few years earlier. The Federal Reserve Banks, and therefore the bond sale campaigns, were organized by twelve Federal Reserve Districts: Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. The Federal Reserve was also responsible for managing the distribution of the funds in the nation's banks and withdrawing funds as they were needed by the government.\n\n The Liberty Loan committees organized highly successful advertising campaigns based on patriotism to inspire the American public to buy the bonds, allowing the Treasury to sell them at a lower interest rate than the market would have set. The advertising campaigns took many forms. The Committee distributed posters and pamphlets, buttons and stickers, and many businesses decorated their store front windows with the ads. Prominent politicians, sports figures, and artists publicly bought bonds, inspiring their fans and supporters to do the same. \"Four Minute Men\" spoke after movies and plays about the importance of buying bonds. Parades were held featuring wounded veterans, and there were war-exhibit trains and aerial demonstrations by skilled fighter pilots that traveled across the country. More than 100,000 clergymen of many denominations delivered Liberty Loan sermons, and in May 1917 the National Women's Liberty Loan Committee was organized under the premise that women would provide a moral force in war finance. The Liberty Loan Committee became one of the largest committees in American history.\n\n The First Liberty Loan of $2 billion was offered to the public in May and June 1917 and quickly oversubscribed by an estimated 4 million Americans. All four subsequent loans were also oversubscribed, in the first three by an increasing number of individuals. The Second Liberty Loan was offered in October 1917, the third was offered April to May 1918, the fourth, the largest of the loans, was offered September to October 1918, and the Victory Loan was offered from April to May 1919. All together, the Liberty Loans raised over 21 billion dollars for the United States war effort. Given the huge sums of money involved, the government needed to balance the movement of the money to avoid disturbing money markets, and the government also required the funds sooner than the Liberty Loan campaigns could provide. One of the most significant tools used to resolve this was through issuing certificates of indebtedness, which were also coordinated by the Federal Reserve. These certificates were short term government loans with low interest rates. Eighty-four series were issued up to June 1921, mostly in anticipation of liberty loans or receipts from taxes, spreading out the payment of funds to the government.\n\n The Liberty Loan campaigns were successful in achieving the Treasury Department's object to market a huge increase in debt at a relatively low direct cost to the Treasury. The public bought most of the debt, and commercial banks bought approximately 20% of the total issue of the loans. The Loans also marked a significant shift in American credit, moving lending and borrowing into the social mainstream, where before it had been the province of skilled investors only.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"type":"bioghist","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","persistent_id":"MC089_b1","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"0a476aad6211907e5b5b6a6b0d02ab33","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The Liberty Loan Committee Records document the four Liberty Loan and the Victory Loan campaigns and include advertisements, committee memoranda, forms and descriptions of the loans, and subscription information.

PER originated in 1991 as a project of the International Research and Exchanges Board (IREX), the American organization that was responsible for the principal exchanges of scholars between the United States and the USSR and Eastern Europe during the Cold War. IREX's then Executive Director, Allen H. Kassof (who was on the Princeton University faculty from 1961 through 1973), had had extensive prior contacts with leaders of the transitions. He planned the project in anticipation of the ethnic disputes that were to follow the collapse of communism. PER's cofounder was Livia Plaks, who was Assistant to the Executive Director at IREX.\n\n In 1992, Kassof stepped down as head of IREX and PER became an autonomous project. Kassof served as President of PER until his retirement in 2005, when Plaks, who had been PER's Executive Director, succeeded him. PER dissolved in 2012.\n\n One of PER's most intensive activities concerned Romania where, over a period of years in the 1990s and into the 2000s, PER helped to negotiate a series of agreements between the main political parties and the leadership of Romania’s ethnic Hungarian minority to ease the tensions between them. In September 2013, Kassof was invited to visit Romania in order to advise senior government officials, including ethnic Hungarian leaders, on steps that might be taken to update the original agreements and understandings, some of which had fallen into disuse. Kassof visited Romania in January and March 2014 and recommended that a series of roundtables be held for political leaders, including several who were alumni of the original talks, as well as younger politicians who were unfamiliar with them. Following these consultations, two roundtables were held in Romania, in May and October 2014. A new Romanian NGO, The Roundtable on Ethnic Relations, was established in September 2016 to sponsor the renewal of PER's efforts."}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"MC249_b1","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The collection consists of paper and digital reports and records of consultations, meetings, roundtables (and discussions and preparations for roundtables), and correspondence with leaders of political parties and representatives of governments and international organizations.

Lanham, a decorated WWII General and good friend of author Ernest Hemingway, was an accomplished author, trainer, and after retiring from the military began a second career as a public relations executive. Prior to commanding the 4th Infantry Division throughout WWII, he served in Washington as a military theorist, writer, and editor. After the war General Lanham served in Europe as commander of the 7th Division before being transferred to General Eisenhower’s staff as the Public Relations Liaison for Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE). Utilizing his PR experience, the retired general had a successful career as business executive for Market Relations, Penn-Texas, and the Xerox Corporation.\n\n Major General Charles \"Buck\" Trueman Lanham was born in Washington, D.C. in 1902. He was a graduate of the West Point Class of 1924. As a newly commissioned lieutenant, Lanham married Mary Gaban. The two had one daughter, Shirley, and remained married until Mary passed away in 1969. A career Infantry officer, he was a longtime contributor and editor of Infantry Journal. General Lanham distinguished himself as a writer of military training, theory, and organization. His authorship went beyond military matters and Harper’s Weekly published several of his works of poetry. The general’s recognized abilities as a military trainer and theorist caused the army brass to deny him field posts throughout the 1930s. As part of his duties in the early 1940s, he wrote and supervised the creation of a series of training films. Already forty years old and colonel when given his first command, he joined the 22nd Infantry Regiment of the 4th Infantry Division on the beaches Normandy. While in France, the 22nd Infantry Regiment’s attached Collier’s war correspondent was Ernest Hemingway. The two writers became close friends until Hemingway’s death.\n\n General Lanham’s unit, along with the 2nd Armored Division, spearheaded the Normandy breakout and was the first unit into Paris, to penetrate the Siegfried Line, and to enter Germany. The 22nd Infantry was engaged in the Battle of Huertgen Forest, sustaining eighty percent casualties in nearly three weeks of combat. The unit was pulled off the frontline to be refitted and supplemented with replacements, but was rushed back into combat during the Battle of the Bulge. In February, Lanham was promoted to Brigadier General and transferred to the 104th as Assistant Commander. He served with the unit until the end of the war, meeting up with the Soviets at the Molde River.\n\n WWII ended, General Lanham returned to Washington to be General Omar Bradley’s Chief of the War Department’s Troop Information and Education Staff. In this position, he directed training and personnel policies for the entire military, and oversaw the unification of the branches. During this period, Lanham’s training materials were criticized as too liberal and not anti-communist enough. This did not adversely affect his career, however, and in 1946 he was named Director of Staff of the Personnel Policy Board under Secretary of Defense Forrestal.\n\n General Lanham served as chief of the military aid group for Belgium and Luxembourg until 1951 when he was named chief of public relations for Supreme Allied Commander, Europe. During his time with the SHAPE, he served as General Eisenhower’s public relations person for both military and political affairs. In January 1953, he was promoted to Major General and named commander of the 1st Infantry Division in West Germany. After a year, General Lanham returned to the United States to serve as deputy commandant of the Armed Forces Staff College before retiring in 1954.\n\n Starting with Market Relations Network, Lanham began a second career as a public relations executive for a number of companies. Later in 1954, he joined Penn-Texas Corporation as chairman of several of the company’s subsidiaries, including Colt’s Patent Firearms. The conglomerate went through a rapid expansion under the guidance of the Silberstein family, with who Lanham was closely aligned. The company’s attempt to acquire the Fairbanks, Morse and Company through a proxy and hostile takeover resulted in a public and acrimonious legal battle. Lanham resigned in 1958 following a disagreement with the Silbersteins over the direction of the company.\n\n Lanham attempted to start his own company, Lanham-Patterson-Wilson, Inc. before joining Xerox two years later as vice president for government relations. He retired from Xerox in 1970, spending his time in Chevy Chase, Maryland with his second wife, Jane Gay, before succumbing to cancer and passing away in 1978.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true}],"publish":true},{"type":"scopecontent","subnotes":[{"content":"The Charles T.

Bowie was a foreign policy expert and legal scholar who served four U.S. administrations as policy planner, counselor, and deputy CIA director, while teaching at Harvard Law School and founding Harvard’s Center for International Affairs. Throughout Bowie’s wide-ranging career, he sustained interests in antitrust issues, European unity, and global arms control.\n\n Robert Richardson Bowie was born in Baltimore, Maryland in 1909. He attended Princeton University, graduating in 1931, and was graduated from Harvard Law School in 1934. He practiced law in Baltimore, Maryland between 1934 and 1942 with the firm Bowie and Burke (together with his father Clarence K. Bowie), and was Maryland’s Assistant Attorney General from 1941 to 1942. He entered the U.S. Army in 1942.\n\n Bowie’s wartime work centered on the renegotiation and termination of war contracts. His Legion of Merit award cites Bowie’s contribution to “an agreement under which the War Department was allowed great flexibility in procedure while retaining the benefits of price control.”\n\n As World War II ended, Bowie was relocated to occupied Berlin as Special Assistant to General Lucius Clay, the Deputy Military Governor of Germany. Bowie formulated policy for the military government in Germany, serving as executive secretary of the Denazification Policy Board. The Oak Leaf Cluster was added to his Legion of Merit award for services in Germany between 1945 and 1946.\n\n Bowie joined the faculty of the Harvard Law School upon his return to the United States, and taught courses in corporate and antitrust law between 1946 and 1955. In 1949, Bowie served on the Hoover Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government, studying federal regulatory agencies including the Federal Reserve Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal Trade Commission.\n\n Bowie went on leave from Harvard 1950-1951, returning to Germany to act as General Counsel and Special Adviser to John J. McCloy, then the U.S. High Commissioner of Germany. Bowie helped to draft McCloy’s speeches, and himself gave a talk in Hamburg entitled “Economic Bases of a Democratic State.” With McCloy, Bowie worked on crafting the agreement between the Allies and West Germany and making the transition from military to civilian government.\n\n During this period, Bowie met Jean Monnet, who was to remain a friend and associate. McCloy and Bowie were among the advocates for the 1950 Schuman Plan (a focal effort of Monnet’s), through which West Germany was integrated into the common market of the European Coal and Steel Community along with France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg in 1952—a precursor to the European Union.\n\n European unity, and Germany’s position in Europe, remained a concern of Bowie’s as the Cold War developed. In 1953, Bowie left Harvard once more to become the State Department’s third Director of Policy Planning. In 1955 he was also named Assistant Secretary of State. During this time, Bowie worked with Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and sat on the National Security Council’s planning board, a new body appointed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\n Bowie’s experience working with Dulles and Eisenhower led to his later participation in recording oral histories about the period, and provided a basis for his authorship with Richard Immerman of Waging Peace: Eisenhower Shaped an Enduring Cold War Strategy. In his reflections and in his writing, he made a case for Eisenhower as a policymaker in his own right.\n\n Returning to Harvard in 1957, Bowie founded the Center for International Affairs (CFIA; now the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs), and was named Clarence Dillon Professor of International Affairs. With Henry Kissinger, Bowie wrote in 1958 in The Program of the Center for International Affairs: “Foreign affairs in our era pose unprecedented tasks.…Today no region is isolated; none can be ignored; actions and events even in remote places may have immediate worldwide impact…the old order has been shattered.” Bowie served as the center’s director from its founding until 1972.\n\n In 1966, Bowie served again in Washington as Counselor to Secretary of State Dean Rusk. He returned to Harvard in 1968. He stepped down as director of the CFIA in 1972. During the mid-1970s he was a member of the Trilateral Commission (formed to create ties between industrialized Japan, Europe and North America) and the Overseas Development Council, among other activities.\n\n In 1977, Bowie was appointed Deputy for National Intelligence under Director of the CIA, Admiral Stansfield Turner, and was responsible for regular briefings to President Carter. He left the CIA in 1979, and retired from Harvard in 1980.\n\n During the 1980s and 1990s, Bowie remained active and engaged in the field of foreign policy. He published a monthly column in the Christian Science Monitor in the early 1980s, and chaired a task force of the Committee for Economic Development in 1982. Bowie was a member of the European Security Study (ESECS), a group of independent defense analysts who advocated bolstering NATO’s conventional weaponry as an alternative to nuclear stockpiling. He was involved with the Council on Foreign Relations, the American Academy of Diplomacy, the Nuclear History Program (a collaboration between France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States), the Woodrow Wilson Center, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, and the Brookings Institution, among other organizations.\n\n Bowie was the author of Studies in Federalism with Carl J. Friedrich in 1954; Shaping the Future: Foreign Policy in an Age of Transition in 1963 [Radner Lectures at Columbia University]; Suez 1956 in 1974; Waging Peace: How Eisenhower Shaped an Enduring Cold War Strategy with Richard Immerman in 1998.\n\n Bowie and the former Mary Theodosia Chapman, known as Teddy, married in 1944 and had two children, Robert R. Bowie, Jr. and William C. Bowie.\n\n Robert Bowie died at age 104 in Maryland in November, 2013.\n\n Sources:\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/21/world/r-bowie-104-dies-advised-4-presidents.html\n\n http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/11/professor-robert-r-bowie-dies-at-104/\n\n Weatherhead Center: http://wcfia.harvard.edu/about"}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"MC290_b1","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The Robert R. Bowie Papers reflect Bowie's government service under four administrations, as well as his position at Harvard University, his Army service and work in the postwar military government of Germany, research for books he wrote, and his later activities as a member of national and international policy and strategy organizations.\n\n  The papers contain four series. The first represents Bowie’s wartime service, when he worked on war contracts, as well as his work towards the reconstruction of Germany—first as Special Assistant to the Deputy Military Governor for Germany, General Lucius Clay (1945-1946), and second as General Counsel to John J. McCloy, U.S. High Commissioner for Germany (1950-1951). The papers include correspondence from these periods, as well as memoranda, drafts of talks, papers, and legal material, and government publications.\n\n The papers in the second series include material originated from both of Bowie’s positions at the United States State Department—as Director of the Policy Planning Staff and Assistant Secretary of State (1953-1957) and as Counselor to the Secretary of State (1966-1968)—in particular, correspondence and memoranda from these periods.\n\n From the period when Bowie served as Deputy Director for National Intelligence at the CIA (1977-1979), the papers contain talking points for presidential briefings, as well as personal correspondence, though agency memoranda and correspondence are absent. This material appears in Series 3 along with papers that relate to Bowie’s activities earlier in the 1970s—as a member of the Trilateral Commission and the Overseas Development Council in particular. Series 3 also includes research files for Bowie’s book Suez 1956 (1974).\n\n Material relating to Bowie’s long professional association with Harvard University appears throughout the papers.

Volcker (1927-) is an economist who has served in several prominent positions in the federal government. Born in Cape May, NJ, Volcker attended Princeton University for his undergraduate education, graduating summa cum laude in 1949. He went on to earn a master's degree in political economy and government from Harvard University in 1951, then studied at the London School of Economics in 1951-1952 under the Rotary Foundation's Ambassadorial Scholarships program.\n\n Volcker began his career in government service in 1952 as an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Five years later, in 1957, he left the position to join the private sector, taking a job at Chase Manhattan Bank. Volcker first worked for the Treasury Department in 1962 as the director of the Office of Financial Analysis, and the following year became the deputy undersecretary for monetary affairs. He resumed work in the private sector once more in 1965, returning to Chase Manhattan Bank as vice president and director of planning.\n\n Volcker served as undersecretary of the Treasury for international monetary affairs from 1969-1974. In this capacity, Volcker was influential in the Nixon administration's economic policy changes of August 1971. These policy changes, particularly the suspension of the U.S. dollar's convertibility to gold and a short-term freeze on wages and prices, temporarily halted inflation and increased the rates of employment and productivity in the United States. After leaving the Treasury Department, Volcker returned to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 1975-1979 to serve as its president.\n\n In August 1979, Jimmy Carter appointed Volcker as chairman of the Board of Governors for the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve under Volcker's leadership is credited with ending the inflation of the 1970s through aggressive control of the money supply, leading to historically high interest rates. By the end his term, the inflation process had ended, giving rise to years of stable growth. As chairman, Volcker also put more focus on the economic conditions in developing countries and prohibiting certain activities of commercial banks.\n\n After leaving the Board of Governors in 1987, Volcker served as chair of the National Commission on Public Service. The following year, he became chairman of Wolfensohn and Co., a boutique international investment banking firm. Volcker was chairman of the Board of Trustees of the International Accounting Standards from 2000-2005.\n\n In 1996, Volcker was asked by representatives of the Swiss and Jewish communities to head an effort to trace accounts of victims of Nazi persecution opened in Swiss banks before World War II, leading to substantial compensation for survivors and their progeny. In 2004, the Secretary General of the United Nations called upon Volcker to undertake an investigation of allegations of substantial corruption by participants in the U.N.'s Oil for Food program and within the U.N. itself. That successful investigation led to a further request by the president of the World Bank to lead a review of the Bank's anti-corruption program, prompting substantial reforms in Bank procedures.\n\n Volcker headed President Obama's Economic Recovery Advisory Board from 2009 to 2011. In this role, he crafted the \"Volcker Rule,\" a provision to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The provision restricts banking institutions in the United States from conducting certain kinds of speculative investment activities.\n\n Volcker was a senior fellow in the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University for the 1974-1975 academic year. He is the coauthor of several books. For many years he chaired the Trilateral Commission and the \"Group of 30,\" consisting of leading central bankers, other financial officials, and financial scholars."}],"persistent_id":"MC279_b1","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","persistent_id":"1f7be3a910c57819f91f782b02db3964","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true,"content":"The Paul A.

He graduated from Princeton University in 1952 and served as a U.S. Army lieutenant in Korea, 1953-1954. In 1955 he began his journalistic career as a reporter for the Charlotte (N.C.) Observer, becoming the paper's Washington correspondent in 1958. From 1961-1965, he was a Washington editor and contributing editor of the Saturday Evening Post magazine. From 1965-1968, he was national affairs correspondent for the Knight Newspapers chain, covering the Vietnam War both at home and abroad. During the next 25 years, he worked for the Washington Post, serving as White House correspondent (1968-1972), Northeast Asia correspondent based in Tokyo (1972-1975), and diplomatic correspondent (1976-1993).\n\n Oberdorfer won the National Press Club's Edwin M. Hood Award for diplomatic correspondence in 1981 and 1988, and Georgetown University's Edward Weintal prize for diplomatic reporting in 1982 and 1993. From 1994-1996, he was president of Overseas Writers, a professional organization of American and foreign journalists who focus on U.S. diplomacy in Washington. Oberdorfer was also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Asia Society, and served as chairman of the Advisory Committee of the Washington Center of the Asia Society from 1986-1989.\n\n In addition to The Turn, Oberdorfer is the author of Tet! (Doubleday, 1971; Da Capo Press, 1984), The Two Koreas: A Contemporary History (Perseus Books, 1997), the D.B. Hardeman Prize-winning Senator Mansfield: The Extraordinary Life of a Great American Statesman and Diplomat (Smithsonian Books, 2003), and numerous magazine articles. He was a visiting professor at Princeton University in 1977, 1982, and 1986 and now serves as a resident scholar with the titles of Distinguished Journalist in Residence and Adjunct Professor of International Relations at Johns Hopkins University's Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). Oberdorfer was named Chairman of the U.S.-Korea Institute at SAIS in September 2006 and became Chairman Emeritus in July 2013.\n\n He was married to the former Laura Klein, and they had two children, Dan and Karen.

Especially noteworthy are Oberdorfer's notes and insights into his overseas travels as the Post's diplomatic correspondent, including his many trips with Secretary of State George P. Shultz. The notebooks also document Oberdorfer's continued interest in foreign affairs after his retirement, particularly in Asia.\n\n Additionally, the collection contains transcripts of interviews conducted by Oberdorfer with both Soviet and American foreign policy officials about events occurring between 1983 and 1990, as well as records detailing those events. Topics discussed include the four summit meetings between President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev (Geneva in 1985, Reykjavik in 1986, Washington in 1987, and Moscow in 1988); the downing of Korean Airlines passenger jet KAL 007; the zero ballistic missiles option raised at Reykjavik; the Strategic Defense Initiative and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty's reinterpretation in connection with it; the Daniloff spy-swap affair; diplomatic missions of George Shultz and Andrei Gromyko; and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). The interviews also detail American and Soviet foreign policy administration and personalities, including Gorbachev's predecessors, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko.\n\n Also included in the collection are typescript drafts of Oberdorfer's unpublished autobiography \"Beyond the First Taxi Zone: Adventures of a Cold War Correspondent,\" which include excerpts from Oberdorfer's notebooks.

Founded in 1920, it has been the recipient of sharp criticism for its willingness to defend unpopular causes and has participated in a majority of the landmark cases to come before the Supreme Court in the twentieth century. The Washington Office's primary responsibility is to monitor legislative issues. In the 1950s the office worked against abuses caused by McCarthyism, including loyalty oath requirements, powers of legislative investigating committees, and censorship of free speech and expression. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the office focused on civil rights issues and the defense of alternative means of self expression.

The collection can be characterized in general as the State Papers of Secretary John Foster Dulles, 1953-1959. The originals of all papers, with the exception of Mr. Dulles's personal appointment book, are located in the Department of State. At the time these documents were filmed for this collection (1956-61)they were located in various State Department repositories, including the Central Files, maintained by the Divison of Records Management (RM), the Conference Files, maintained by the Reports and Operations Staff of the Secretariat (S/S-RO), miscellaneous files kept in the S/S/-RO Message Center, and various individual State Department Bureau and Office files. It can be presumed that eventually all of these records will be retired to the Central Files where the master copies will be maintained.\n\n The collection can be broken down into nine general categories as described below:\n\n (1)Conferences held between Secretary Dulles and representatives of foreign nations. This category includes (a) special, high-level international conferences, e.g., the Geneva Summit Meetings, July, 1955; (b) regular international meetings attended by Secretary Dulles, e.g., the annual Spring meetings of the NATO Ministerial Council; and (c) bilateral meetings between Secretary Dulles and representatives of foreign poewrs either in Washington or in other capitals. The documents in this category as well as in categories (2) and (3) below are chiefly telegrams exchanged between the Department of State and various US Missions, memos of conversation, conference minutes, and background and position papers prepared for the Secretary's use prior to meetings which he was to attend.\n\n (2) Negotiations with foreign powers carried out chiefly by representatives of Secretary Dulles. The most important of these are (a) the Korean Truce negotiations; (b) the Trieste Treaty negotiations; (c) the Austrian State Treaty negotiations; (d) the Baghdad Pact (Henderson mission) negotiations; (e) the Formosa-Offshore Island negotiations; and (f) negotiations with Communist CHina for the release of US prisoners.\n\n (3) General foreign relations with individual nations or groups of nations (1953-1956). In this category falls background material not fully covered in conference files (Category 1) or elsewhere. It includes documents dealing with relations in the period 1953-1956 between the United States and (a) Indo China; (b) Pakistan and India; and (c) Israel and the Arab League of Nations.\n\n (4) Secretary Dulles's Memos of Conversation. This is an almost complete file of all official memoranda of conversations in which the Secretary participated from January 1953 through 15 April 1959. The other participants were chiefly representatives of foreign nations. Some of these memos are duplicated in the conference files (Category 1).\n\n (5) Secretary Dulles's Appointment Book. This is a daily record kept in pencil by Mr. Dulles personal secretary of all appointments kept by him either in Washington or abroad. It covers the entire period of Mr. Dulles's term of office as Secretary of State. Because there was no room to do so, the pages of these books were not stamped with frame numbers. These books represent the only part of this collection that cannot technically be labeled official documents; consequently they bear no security classification.\n\n (6) Top Secret Daily Staff Summaries and Top Secret Afternoon Summaries. The Top Secret Staff Summary (including, after 13 September 1956 the Top Secret Afternoon Summary) is edited and produced daily (except Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) by the Reports and Operations Staff of the Secretariat (S/S-RO). It is the joint work of S/S-RO and the policy information officers in various bureaus of the Department of State including the Bureau of Intelligence and Research. It reports on a daily basis major policy decisions or related developments as contained in Top Secret telegrams, dispatches, etc., exchanged between the Department of State and various US Missions. The master copies of the Summaries, which have been filmed for this collection, identify by number the specific telegrams or dispatches on which the summaries are based. For a time, the Top Secret Staff Summary contained a section on \"Congressional Relations\" and a daily \"Signature Record\" of correspondence signed by the Secretary, the Under Secretary, and the Acting Secretary. The Congressional Relations section was dropped after 8 May 1953, and the \"Signature Record\" was dropped after 19 March 1956. Beginning 4 August 1953, a section was added summarizing \"major decisions\" made daily by the Secretary, Under Secretary, and Acting Secretary. The title of this section was later changed to \"The Staff Record\" and (in the Afternoon Summary)\"Record of Actions.\" The Top Secret Staff Summary has a very restricted circulation in the Department of State and is considered an \"Eyes Only\" document, that is for the \"personal information and use of the designated recipient only.\" It was one of the most important documents regularly studied by Secretary Dulles. For the study of major developments in US foreign policy on a daily basis these documents provide a highly useful starting point.\n\n (7) The Daily Summary. The Daily Summary is edited and produced daily (except Saturday, Sundays, and holidays) in the Reports and Operations Staff of the Secretariat (S/S-RO). It is the joint work of the S/S-RO and the policy information officers in various Bureaus of the Department of State. It reports, on a daily basis, major policy decisions or related development as contained in telegrams, dispatches, etc., classified up through Secret. It is produced primarily for the use of officers at the level of Assistant Secretary, Deputy Assistant Secretary, Office Director, and Deputy Office Director.\n\n (8) Secretary's Staff Meetings (Tuesday and Thursday). These are minutes of the semi-weekly large staff meetings held by the Secretary of State and attended chiefly by Assistant Secretaries and staff assistants.\n\n (9) Secretary's Staff Meetings (Mondays, Wednesday and Friday). These are informal and uncleared minutes of the Secretary's small staff meetings attended chiefly by the Under Secretary, the Deputy Under Secretaries, and the Assistant Secretaries or their equivalents. There are some gaps in the record for the years 1953-1955, and for the same period the record consists mostly of pencilled notes. After March 1956 the record is complete and is in typescript."}],"type":"scopecontent","publish":true},{"subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true,"content":"There are two categories of reels: 148 containing documents other than telegrams, and 44 containing telegrams only, which were filmed separately for reasons of cryptographic security.\n\n 1. Microfilms Each reel of microfilms has a number, the numbers running from 1 through 144 and from 201 through 248. For security reasons, the microfilm reels have been separated into two categorise. Those reels numbered from 1 through 100 and from 201 through 248 contain copies of documents other than telegrams, e.g., memos of conversation, conference minutes, etc. Those numbered from 101 through 144 contain copies of telegrams which, for reasons of cryptographic security, have been filmed separately.\n\n Each page of each document has been stamped, before being microfilmed, with a separate number, usually in the lower left-hand corner. This is the 'frame number,\" i.e., the number assigned to each microfilm frame within each microfilm reel. All documents or individual pages of documents can thus be easily identified by reel number and frame number. At the beginning of each reel is a \"target sheet.\" This sheet in bold type identifies by subject matter the ensuing groop of filmed documents; indicates, where possible, the State Department file number of the original documents and their location, at the time of filming, within the various file systems of the Department of State; and gives the inclusive, frame numbers within that particular reel.\n\n Where the original films were unclear because of faulty photography, retakes have been made in most cases. These retakes are identified as such and have been spliced in at the beginning of the appropriate microfilm reels. In some cases the original documents were so faintly or badly typed that the microfilm copies are scarcely legible, and no amount of rephotographing could improve the situation. In these instances, recourse will have to be made to the original documents in the files of the Department of State.\n\n 2. Telegrams The telegrams contained in reels 101 through 144 are mostly those exchanged between the Department of State and the regular US diplomatic posts abroad or the UN mission in New York. Some, however, fall into special categories and are identifiable by the cable addresses used, as listed below:\n\n (a) DULTE-TEDUL DULTE is the cable address used in highly classified telegrams of limited distribution sent to the Department of State by Secretary Dulles when absent from the Deparmtent on a mission. TEDUL is the cable address use on telegrams addressed by the Department of State to Secretary Dulles under like circumstances.\n\n (b) SECTO-TOSEC SECTO is the cable address used in telegrams of less limited distribution sent to the Department of State by the Secretary of State when absent from the Department on a mission. TOSEC is the cable address used on telegrams addressed by the Department of State to the Secretary of State under like circumstances. (Note: the DULTE-TEDUL series and the SECTO-TOSEC series often contain telegrams concerning subjects not pertinent to the specific purposes of the Secretary's trip abroad. Therefore important telegrams concerning many different subjects are to be found in these exchanges of telegrams which are normally located and catalogued in this collection under the general subject describing the occasion of the Secretary's trip abroad. For example the Suez crisis of July 1956 broke when Secretary Dulles was in Panama and South America. Therefore, important telegrams concerning this crisis will be found in the DULTE-TEDUL series grouped under the subject, \"Panama Conference.\"\n\n (c) POLTO-TOPOL POLTO is the cable address used in telegrams sent by the US Mission to NATO and European Regional Organizations in Paris to the Department of State. TOPOL is the cable address used in telegrams sent by the Department of State to the US Mission to NATO and European Regional Organizations in Paris.\n\n 3. Log of Documents. The log, copies of which are deposited in both the Seeley G. Mudd Manuscript Library at Princeton and the Historical Office, Department of State, contains a separate page for each microfilm reel. Each page of the log includes the following information: (a) reel number; (b) inclusive frame numbers; (c) repository of original documents within the Department of State at the time of filming; (d) State Department file numbers of documents (when possible); (e) frame numbers of retakes (when necessary); and (f) subject or subjects of the documents included in the ree, as described on the target sheet for each reel.\n\n 4. Card catalogue Copies of the card catalogue are deposited in both the Seeley G. Mudd Manuscript Library at Princeton and the Historical Office, Department of State. The card catalogue provides a general, but not detailed, index of the collection. Each card contains the following information: (a) single words subject in the upper left-hand corner;* (b) cryptographic classification of document in upper right-hand corner;** (c) general subject of document or group documents as described on target sheets of the microfilm reels; (b) reel number; and (e) frame numbers. The cards are filed alphabetically according to the subject heading in the upper left-hand corner.\n\n Philip A. Crowl, Washington, D.C., 1962\n\n Updated upon declassification: Princeton, New Jersey, 1999\n\n *Any given document or group of documents contained in a single reel is normally listed under several subjects. For example, for the subject, \"Second Suez Canal Conference, London, September, 1956,\" three separate cards are to be found int he catalogue: one bears, in the upper left-hand corner, the title, \"Egypt\"; another, the title, \"Suez Canal\"; and the third, the title, \"London Conference.\"\n\n **All telegrams are included in the \"encrypted\" category; all other documents in the \"non-encrypted\" category."}],"type":"arrangement","persistent_id":"7a6cfca472848580d4d0b7684b19280b","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","publish":true},{"type":"accessrestrict","persistent_id":"a552d3b07f9559247064d8117cb79a80","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","rights_restriction":{"local_access_restriction_type":[]},"subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true,"content":"LINKED DIGITAL CONTENT NOTE: Please note that some previously linked digital content is temporarily unavailable while the data is being migrated from an outdated access service.

Roger Nash Baldwin Papers document the life and career of Roger Baldwin (1884-1981), a prominent and active American civil libertarian for almost all of his prodigiously long life. Baldwin is remembered first and foremost as a founder of the American Civil Liberties Union. Many of the papers in this collection document his involvement with the conscientious objection movement that served as the forerunner to the ACLU and with the Union itself. He served as both its executive director from its foundation in 1920 to his retirement in 1950 and as an advisor from that date until his death in 1981. However, Baldwin cast his net much wider than just the ACLU. During the 1920s and 1930s, he was involved with various left-wing political organizations, including the Industrial Workers of the World. Following the end of World War II, he served as an advisor to the U.S. Army and the United Nations in Germany, Austria, Japan, and Korea, guiding the establishment of democracy in those countries, and he was for many years chair of the International League for the Rights of Man. He spoke and wrote widely, most often on issues of civil liberties and human rights, and also taught periodically throughout his life. The papers, which include correspondence, memos, writings, notes, and photographs, document all aspects of his public life, as well as some portion of his personal life."],"jsonmodel_type":"note_singlepart","publish":true},{"content":["mudd"],"jsonmodel_type":"note_singlepart","persistent_id":"3da09cff976f46f36c70fc783375ea65","type":"physloc","publish":true},{"type":"scopecontent","subnotes":[{"content":"The Baldwin Papers consist mainly of typescript and manuscript documents, including personal correspondence, business correspondence, memoranda, published and typescript articles, manuscripts and notes for speeches, notes from travels, and printed material. There are also a considerable number of photographs and an album presented to Baldwin at the Thirtieth Anniversary of the ACLU, on February 22, 1950. The vast majority of the documents are in English, but there is also material in Spanish, German, and French, much but not all of which is translated.\n\n While there are materials relating to all eras of Baldwin's life, from his childhood in Wellesley, Massachusetts to his death in 1981, some eras are more fully documented than others. The collection contains no documents from his undergraduate years at Harvard. Much of the material relating to Baldwin's term as executive director of the ACLU (1920-1950) is located in the ACLU Archives. The papers in this collection relating directly to the ACLU date almost exclusively from 1950. The only exceptions are papers relating to the Scopes trial, which Baldwin managed, and the Sacco-Vanzetti case, which are relatively well-represented here. There are also surprisingly few documents relating to Baldwin's involvement with the International League for the Rights of Man.\n\n On the other hand, the materials relating to Baldwin's year in prison, his travels to the Soviet Union, Japan, Korea, and Germany, his interest in Puerto Rico, and his years in St. Louis are relatively rich. Baldwin's FBI file, although censored, sheds light on his involvement in radical politics. Also of interest are the memoranda Baldwin wrote throughout his later years about people he had known, experiences he had, and beliefs he had held. The photographs include many formal portraits of\n\n Baldwin, his first baby picture to several taken while he was in his nineties, snapshots of dinners held in his honor, a few family pictures, pictures taken during his trips to Japan, Korea, and Germany, and various other photographs of his public life.\n\n An unusual feature of this collection is that Baldwin himself has included specifically for the researcher occasional explanations of who people were, what his connection with them was, or why he saved something. Baldwin also wrote a series of memoranda about his life, people he knew, and his opinions and attitudes. These autobiographical addenda to the collection infuse the collection with an unusually immediate sense of Baldwin's presence.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true}],"persistent_id":"f0ff3f733f6b5ba2b2fc5ccc6e0982f9","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","publish":true},{"type":"accessrestrict","persistent_id":"e5fdec80aae6c0f76bd9773fa45ba3f7","subnotes":[{"content":"LINKED DIGITAL CONTENT NOTE: Please note that some previously linked digital content is temporarily unavailable while the data is being migrated from an outdated access service.

Robert Lansing Papers document the later years of Robert Lansing (1864-1928), lawyer, writer, and the longest serving of Woodrow Wilson's three Secretaries of State. During his tenure as Secretary of State (June 23, 1915 to February 13, 1920), the United States entered the First World War on the side of the Entente Powers. Deliberations and negotiations associated with the precarious neutrality which preceded this event and the troubled peace which followed it dominated Lansing's time in office and are reflected in his papers. Lansing's interests as a lawyer, which were international in scope and substance, and the diverse subjects which commanded his attention as a writer – subjects ranging from biblical history to English etymology – are also evident. The Lansing Papers consist of official papers, personal papers, writings and speeches, diaries, sketches, and photographs.

The son of John and Maria Lay (Dodge) Lansing, he could trace his American ancestry to the middle years of the seventeenth century. His religious and political loyalties were Presbyterian and Democratic. He attended Amherst College in Massachusetts, graduating in 1886, and, like his father and grandfather before him, entered the legal profession. He joined his father's practice following his admission to the bar in 1889, but it was his father-in-law and one-time Secretary of State, John Watson Foster, who interested him in global affairs and the international arbitral panels before which he would appear more often than any American lawyer of the time. In 1892, he was named associate counsel for the United States in the Bering Sea Arbitration, an appointment which took him to Paris. In the years which followed, he represented American interests before such bodies as the Bering Sea Claims Commission, the Alaskan Boundary Tribunal, the North Atlantic Coast Fisheries Arbitration, the Fur Seal Conference, and the British and American Claims Arbitration. In addition to private interests, he served as counsel for the Mexican and Chinese legations in Washington between 1894 and 1895 and 1900 and 1901. In 1906, Lansing helped to found the American Society of International Law, and, in 1907, he helped to launch the American Journal of International Law, of which he became an associate editor.\n\n On March 27, 1914, he was appointed Counselor for the Department of State, unaware of the burdens soon to be imposed on him by the outbreak of the First World War. As the second highest official in the department, he was called upon to serve as acting secretary in the absence of William Jennings Bryan. Bryan's resignation over the ramifications of the sinking of the Lusitania opened the way for Lansing's appointment as Secretary of State on June 23, 1915, an unusual choice on Wilson's part in light of Lansing's lack of political stature. The President and his confidant, Edward Mandell House, exercised far more influence over the conduct of foreign policy than Lansing, but his familiarity with the workings of international law was an asset as the administration grappled with the thorny questions arising from the need to define and safeguard the rights of neutrals in a world at war.\n\n Neutrality, which had grown steadily more untenable as hostilities intensified, was abandoned in 1917. Diplomatic ties with Germany were severed on February 3, and a state of war was declared to exist between the countries on April 6, developments Lansing both expected and welcomed. In the first days of his tenure, he had outlined in a private memorandum his views on Germany, noting that \"German absolutism is the great menace to democracy\" and raising the specter of a triumphant reich allying itself with an autocratic Russia and Japan in a coordinated assault on human liberty. He was not, however, an advocate of revenge, dubbing the reparations bruited by Great Britain and France \"simple madness.\" The positions of foreign leaders were not the only ones he questioned as the spotlight shifted from the battlefield to the conference table. Lansing, who travelled to Paris as a member of the American Commission to Negotiate Peace, found himself in irreconcilable disagreement with Wilson over a number of issues, the most important of which concerned the nature of the President's beloved League of Nations and the wisdom of framing its covenant in conjunction with the treaties of peace. Lansing went so far as to question the appropriateness of his superior's presence in Paris on the grounds that it would lessen his stature and, thus, his influence at home and abroad. Lansing's advice on these and other matters was unwelcome, and though he was one of the signatories of the Treaty of Versailles, his ability to influence events was minimal.\n\n While issues associated with the First World War occupied center stage during his time in office, Lansing was also obliged to deal with the volatile political situation in Mexico and the tensions which threatened to spark a full-scale war between this strife-torn country and the United States. Differences with Wilson over the propriety of intervention in Mexican affairs in the fall of 1919 did nothing to narrow the rift between them. Haiti and the Dominican Republic, which were occupied by American troops in 1915 and 1916 respectively, constituted minor flash points and, as such, afforded Lansing greater scope for independent action. Strains in Japanese-American relations were a matter of concern as well, particularly in regard to the status of China. The Lansing-Ishii Agreement, negotiated in the fall of 1917, was intended to preserve China's territorial integrity and political independence while recognizing – ominously in light of later events – Japan's \"special interests\" there. The Bolshevik revolution posed challenges as novel as they were farreaching, not least of which was the collapse of the eastern front. Lansing loathed Bolshevism, which he described in a private memorandum as \"the most hideous and monstrous thing that the human mind has ever conceived,\" and opposed extending diplomatic recognition to the new regime.\n\n The last months of Lansing's tenure as Secretary of State were overshadowed by domestic opposition to the peace settlement arrived at in Paris, culminating in the refusal of the Senate to ratify the Treaty of Versailles, and the physical and psychological collapse of Wilson in the fall of 1919. In the resultant vacuum, Lansing felt it proper to summon meetings of the cabinet, a practice which aroused the ire of the convalescent President, who accused him of usurping presidential power. Lansing's resignation, which took effect on February 13, 1920, was as willingly offered as it was accepted. Lansing had, in fact, considered resigning well before this point, privately likening his position to that of \"a school boy or a rubber stamp,\" but his sense of duty had restrained him.\n\n Now he happily returned to private life. He resumed the practice of international law in partnership with Lester Hood Woolsey, who had served as Solicitor for the Department of State, and was retained by a number of countries. They included Chile, whose interests he and Woolsey represented in the Tacna-Arica Arbitration. Lansing used his new leisure to record his opinions and impressions of the peace conference, though he refrained from publicizing his disagreements with Wilson until the change in administrations in 1921, and he was working on an extensive account of his years as Secretary of State at the time of his death. His examination of the peace conference took the form of two books, The Peace Negotiations: A Personal Narrative and The Big Four and Others of the Peace Conference, and part of his unfinished manuscript was published posthumously under the title, War Memoirs of Robert Lansing. He died in Washington, D.C. on October 30, 1928."}],"publish":true},{"persistent_id":"85a33635003a1b2231fd55462b64984a","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true,"content":"With the exception of a small number of sketches and photographs, the Lansing Papers consist exclusively of typescript and manuscript material, including letters, telegrams, memoranda, essays, addresses, and diaries. While this material documents many of Lansing's concerns, particularly in his capacity as a lawyer, writer, and public official, there are significant lacunae. Among Lansing's official and personal papers, some years are entirely unrepresented while others are virtually so. Enclosures referred to in letters are often missing. There is a ten-year gap in his diaries between 1910 and 1921. While his writings and speeches are also incomplete – the absence of his most widely noted work, The Peace Negotiations: A Personal Narrative, is a case in point – they form by far the largest and, in many respects, the most revealing body of material in the Lansing Papers. Lansing's literary and scholarly works are well-represented, as are his treatments of contemporary issues arising within and without the corridors of power.\n\n Lansing was a reflective man who committed his views to paper both during and after the events in which he was involved. The principal insights which the Lansing Papers offer are related less to the daily workings of public and private life than to the concerns and convictions which underpin them. To the extent that Wilson was his own Secretary of State and denied Lansing his confidence, particularly in the closing months of their association, it is perhaps appropriate that Lansing's thoughts bulk larger than his actions in these papers. Through them, his character and environment can be gauged. A biographical sketch prepared for The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography could be accused of over-enthusiasm in averring that Lansing occupied \"a preeminent position in the councils of the world,\" but it is plain that he was part of the dynamics if not necessarily the decisions which shaped the fortunes of the United States and its neighbors at a pivotal point in the twentieth-century.

Thompson was educated in public and private schools in the Trenton area and entered Wake Forest College and Law School in North Carolina, receiving his LL.B. in 1941.\n\n After leaving Wake Forest, Thompson served in the Navy for seven years, which included service in World War II. He was elected to the New Jersey House of Assembly in November 1949 and served until war broke out in Korea. During the war, he served for 17 months as commanding officer of Naval Reserve Battalion 4-22.\n\n Thompson was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1954 and initially assigned to the committees on Education, Labor, and Administration. Over the course of his Congressional career, he chaired the House Administration Committee, the Subcommittee on Labor and Management Relations, the Joint Committee on Printing, as well as the National Voters Registration Committee. Thompson placed an emphasis on education, music and the arts. Among legislation he introduced or cosponsored were bills to grant federal aid to college students, to support historic preservation, and to ease the tariff laws on art, among others. Thompson also fought to uphold and expand civil rights. He voted for the civil rights bills of 1956 and 1957. In 1956, he defended the right of a Princeton University campus society to invite Alger Hiss for a speaking engagement. In addition, Thompson took an active interest in matters of international relations. He favored a three-year reciprocal trade renewal bill, the Eisenhower Middle East Doctrine, and increasing of United States subscriptions to the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. On military matters he supported the Dept. of Defense Reorganization Act and an extension of the draft. A close political ally of the Kennedy family, Thompson ran John F. Kennedy's voter registration drive in 1960.\n\n He voted against the Powell amendment to the school construction bill which prohibited federal funds to any state that does not comply with Supreme Court decisions. He was also opposed to killing the school construction bill of July 1957. Other domestic issues which he supported include policies to increase Congressional salaries to $25,000, restore rigid farm price supports, liberalize the Social Security Act, raise the minimum wage to $1 an hour, build 45,000 public housing units, construct the Colorado River storage project, grant statehood to Alaska and Hawaii, and authorize the Tennessee Valley Authority to issue $750 billion of revenue bonds to finance new power facilities.\n\n Thompson's political career came to an end following his 1980 Abscam indictment and conviction. He served two years in prison near Lexington, Kentucky and moved to his home in Alexandria, VA .

The bulk of the collection comprises research material for Austin's second major work of political history, Working a Democratic Constitution, much of which was compiled between 1988 and 1999. The collection also includes some research material for Austin's first book, The Indian Constitution: Cornerstone of a Nation (1966).\n\n Most of the research files are published articles or book excerpts that Austin collected and often annotated. Some of Austin’s notes on his interviews and records of meetings, travel plans, names and addresses of sources, and drafts of his writings are included. Research material on India also includes original booklets and pamphlets from the Indian government and political parties, speech transcripts, news clippings from Indian newspapers, copies of correspondence and memoranda between leaders in India’s government, and copies of oral history transcripts housed at the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library.\n\n Topics covered by these sources include the Indian constitution, center-state relations in India, Indian politicians and political parties, U.S. foreign relations with India, cases tried before the Indian Supreme Court, and various other subjects related to India's political and legal systems. The research primarily covers the period in India's political history from 1946 to 1985.\n\n The collection also documents Austin’s work in between and following his two major books—his writing on the Middle East, specifically the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and peace process; his work at the State Department and other government agencies; his work in Beirut as press attaché with the U.S. Information Service; his writing on public policy in education; and his involvement with the organization ICWA and with the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. \n\n  The collection also contains both professional correspondence (including that related to his work with the U.S. State Department), personal correspondence, and appointment books, documenting some of Austin’s job searches as well as his work, travel, and social life. Travel notebooks, datebooks, and account books, as well as published travel guides, maps and ephemera reflect some of Austin’s research trips, including those to India.

(Wallace) Notestein contributed significantly to the science of demography and to a better understanding of population problems in world affairs, notably through his work on family planning and population control. Born in Alma, Michigan in 1902, Notestein received his undergraduate degree from the College of Wooster in 1923. He earned his PhD in Economics from Cornell University in 1927 and was an Economics instructor there from 1926-1927. From 1927 through 1928, Notestein worked abroad as a fellow of the Social Sciences Research Council. He began work for the Milbank Memorial Fund, an endowed national foundation that supports nonpartisan analysis, study, and research on significant issues in health policy, as a research assistant and then became a member of its technical staff from 1929 through 1936, working on differential fertility, the total genetic contribution to the next generation.\n\n In 1936, Notestein began as a Lecturer at Princeton University. At the same time, he developed and directed the Office of Population Research (OPR) at Princeton’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs with funding from the Milbank Memorial Fund. The OPR focused on the study of the interrelation of population growth and change in underdeveloped areas and on the social and psychological factors affecting fertility in the American family. By 1941, Notestein had attained full professorship as the Director of the OPR and as a professor of Demography, holding both titles until his resignation in 1959. Notestein remained as \"Acting Director\" of the OPR for the fall 1959 term while his successor, Ansley J. Coale, took a sabbatical. After Notestein’s resignation, he remained involved at Princeton as a \"Visiting Senior Demographer\" through 1963. In addition, he was a \"Visiting Lecturer in Public and International Affairs,\" at Princeton beginning in 1968. He maintained both positions until June 1982.\n\n Notestein’s resignation from full professorship and director of the OPR at Princeton allowed him to become the president of the Population Council (PC) until 1968. The PC was founded in 1952 by John D. Rockefeller III to study and promote understanding of the scientific aspects of population change throughout the world by fostering scientific theory and research in social, economic and medical fields. Notestein had been a trustee of the PC since its establishment.\n\n Along with Notestein’s positions at Princeton and the PC, he was the organizer and first director of the Population Division of the United Nations, 1946-1948. In 1955 he advised India’s Minister of Health on population policies and beginning a population center for training and research on demography in India. He chaired the Technical Advisory Committee on Population for the 1950 United States Census and was a member of the 1960 United States Census Committee.\n\n Notestein was a co-editor of the Population Index, a bibliography of population literature that was the official publication of the Population Association of American and the OPR from 1936-1957. He co-authored Controlled Fertility in 1940 and The Future Population of Europe and the Soviet Union in 1944, as well as authoring numerous journal publications. Notestein was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Sociological Association, and the American Statistical Association. He was a member of the American Eugenics Society, the American Philosophical Society, the Council on Foreign Relations, the International Statistical Institute, the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population, the Population Association of America, and the Century Association.\n\n Notestein married Daphne Limbach in 1927; they had no children.

He was a member of the foreign service intermittently between 1930 and 1971, after which time he devoted himself full-time to writing and teaching. Yost served in Egypt, Poland, Thailand, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Greece, France, Laos, Syria, and Morocco.\n\n Charles Woodruff Yost was born in Watertown, New York, on November 6, 1907. Prior to attending Princeton University, he traveled throughout Europe and was interviewed by his local newspaper, The Watertown Daily Times. After graduating from Princeton University in 1928, he traveled to Paris to complete post-graduate work.\n\n Yost joined the Foreign Service in 1930, serving first in Alexandria, Egypt as a consular officer and then in Poland. He left the Foreign Service in 1933 to pursue a career as a freelance foreign correspondent in Europe. In 1935, he rejoined the State Department in Washington, D.C., becoming assistant chief of the Division of Arms and Munitions Control. In 1941, he represented the State Department on the Policy Committee of the Board of Economic Warfare. Yost was appointed Assistant Chief of Special Research in 1942 and assistant chief of the Division of Foreign Activity Correlation in 1943. In February 1944, he became executive secretary of the Department of State Policy Committee. He attended the Dumbarton Oaks Conference from August to October 1944, the United Nations Organization Conference in San Francisco in April 1945, and the Potsdam Conference in July 1945.\n\n In late 1945, Yost was named chargè d'affaires to Thailand. Throughout the late 1940s and 1950s, he served in Czechoslovakia, Austria and Greece, all countries under political pressure from the Soviet Union. In 1954, he was named minister to Laos and became the first United States ambassador to that nation. In 1957, he was the minister counselor, or second-in-command, of the American Embassy in Paris. At the end of that year, he was named ambassador to Syria. Shortly after his appointment, Syria and Egypt formed the United Arab Republic. Yost was named ambassador to Morocco in 1958.\n\n In 1961, he began his first assignment at the United Nations as the deputy to Ambassador Adlai E. Stevenson. Following Stevenson's death in 1965, Yost stayed on as Arthur Goldberg's deputy. Yost obtained the rank of career ambassador, the highest professional Foreign Service rank, before resigning from the Foreign Service in 1966 to begin his career as a writer and teacher on foreign affairs.\n\n In 1969, President Richard Nixon nominated Yost as the permanent United States Representative to the United Nations. He advised the President and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger on relationships with the Middle East, the Soviet Union, Southern Africa, and arms control. He resigned in 1971 and returned to writing and teaching.\n\n Yost set forth his views in a syndicated newspaper column and in four books: The Age Of Triumph And Frustration: Modern Dialogues (New York: R. Speller, 1964), The Insecurity of Nations (New York: Published for the Council on Foreign Relations [by] Praeger, 1968), The Conduct and Misconduct of Foreign Relations (New York: Random House, 1972), and History and Memory (New York: Norton, 1980). He also taught at the Columbia University School of International Affairs and Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service. He gave speeches throughout his career, offering his perspective on the Middle East, Southern Africa, China, and the Soviet Union.\n\n In 1979, Yost was co-chairman of Americans for SALT II, a group that lobbied the Senate for passage of the second Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty. He was a trustee of the American University in Cairo, Egypt and director of the Aspen Institute for cultural exchanges with Iran. He also took part in several unofficial conferences between the United States and Soviet scholars. In 1973, he was named head of the National Committee on United States-China Relations and visited the People's Republic of China in 1973 and 1977.\n\n Yost died of cancer in May 1981 at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"MC193_b1","publish":true},{"type":"scopecontent","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"Yost's papers document his professional life in the Foreign Service, as well as his time in academia, and include his correspondence, writings, and photographs.

She attended boarding school in Maryland and enrolled at Smith College in 1932. After her first year at Smith, Martindell's father insisted that she return home, maintaining that no man would want to marry an educated woman. (Martindell, who had wanted to go on to law school, would later return to Smith College and earn her bachelor's degree in the class of 2002, at the age of 87. She was also awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.) After leaving Smith, Martindell married George Scott, with whom she had three children. Martindell divorced Scott after thirteen years of marriage. She later married Jackson Martindell, owner of the Who's Who publications, and had a son.\n\n Martindell was in her fifties when she first became active in politics. She attended the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago in support of Senate candidate Eugene McCarthy, where she observed the violence against protesters of the Vietnam War. Shortly thereafter, she was invited to become vice-chair of the New Jersey Democratic Party. After four years in that post, Martindell was encouraged to run for the state senate seat in predominantly Republican Mercer County, and after an unexpected victory she spent her four-year term concentrating on women's issues, education, and the environment. While in the state senate, she served as chair of the Education Committee, member of the Appropriations Committee, chair of the Budget Revision Subcommittee for Higher Education, chair of the Joint State Library Committee, member of the Senate Nursing Home Commission, and chair of the Committee to Defeat Casino Gambling.\n\n Martindell attended the 1976 Democratic National Convention as a Carter delegate, and was an active voice for Jimmy Carter throughout New Jersey. After Carter's election to the presidency, Martindell was appointed to the Commission to Review Ambassadorial Appointments, and went on to become director of the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), part of the State Department's Agency for International Development. In the course of her work for OFDA, she surveyed the reconstruction efforts at natural disaster sites throughout the world. This work would eventually bring her to the attention of the Ambassadorship Review Board. She was later nominated for the ambassadorship to New Zealand and Western Samoa in 1979, and served in that capacity until 1981.\n\n During her two-year term as ambassador, Martindell traveled widely, and worked hard to improve and maintain positive relations between the U. S. and New Zealand. As the first female ambassador to New Zealand, she faced some resistance, but her persistence and personal charm endeared her to the people of New Zealand. She met New Zealand painter Tosswill Woollaston during her time as ambassador, and maintained a close relationship with him until his death in 1998.\n\n After returning from New Zealand, Martindell retained close ties with the country, helping to found the United States-New Zealand Council in 1986. Though she continued to travel frequently, Martindell remained active in New Jersey politics as a fundraiser and donor"}],"type":"bioghist","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","publish":true},{"subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true,"content":"The Anne Martindell papers document Martindell's personal and professional activities from the 1920s to the 1990s.

Bernard Ryan was a Lawyer and a Judge on the New York State Court of Claims. William Fitts attended the Albion public schools and then Princeton University, graduating in 1944 with a BA. He fought in the Philippines with the U.S. Army rising to the rank of first lieutenant and also served with the occupation forces in Japan. After the army he earned a law degree from Columbia University in 1949 and practiced law briefly with the New York City firm of Hatch, Wolfe, Nash and Ten Eyck.\n\n Soon he joined Manhattan District Attorney Frank Hogan's team, serving as an Assistant District Attorney from 1950 to 1957. At the same time he worked for the election of Adlai Stevenson (1956), meeting Eleanor Roosevelt and Herbert Lehman. In 1957 Ryan resigned from the DA's office and set out on his own political career. Ryan founded the first reform club called the Riverside Democrats, using it as a base to run for a West Side district leadership post. He was successful in this election and was re-elected to the post two years later.\n\n In 1960 he upset Representative Ludwig Teller, capturing the 20th District seat in the House of Representatives and started on his long career in Washington politics. Soon after he was elected, he attacked the House Committee on Un-American Activities, being one of only six Congressmen who voted to cut off HUAC's appropriation. In 1961 he was labelled a radical for calling for admission of Red China to the United Nations, for suggesting arms control at the height of the Cold War, and for marching with Dr. Martin Luther King in support of the civil rights movement.\n\n During the 1960's, he called for a full investigation of Federal Housing Administration, a one billion dollar Title One program which was to provide money for middle income housing, proposed a permanent Civil Rights Commission, introduced two bills to prevent racial discrimination in the sale and rental of housing in Washington D.C., proposed bills aimed at protecting migrant workers, supported Medicare, introduced the Jury Selection Act, called for a broadening of Selective Service System into a National Service Program, sponsored the Gateway National Park Bill, created the law that banned poisonous lead paints from residential buildings, and urged the impeachment of President Nixon for \"war crimes.\"\n\n During the 1960's he was an early opponent of the Vietnam War, fought against legislation to establish the Communications Satellite Corporation, voted against authorized corporal punishment in District of Columbia schools, joined 16 other liberal Democrats in an attempt to bar seating of the Mississippi membership in the House pending settlement by the Negro Freedom Democratic Party (who contended Negroes were not permitted to register and vote in Mississippi), spoke against the insistence of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare that Medicare required a disclaimer of Communist affiliation, voted against Johnson's supplemental defense and foreign economic aid appropriations bill, and fought to defeat the Comsat project.\n\n Ryan was a member of the Science and Astronautics Committee and also the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. In 1968 he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention. During his political career the only election he lost was the 1965 Democratic Mayoral Primary in New York City.\n\n In 1949 he married Priscilla Marbury and had one son and three daughters: William Fitts, Jr., Priscilla, Virginia, and Catherine. He was a member of the Riverside Democrats Inc., New York Reform Democratic Movement, and the New York Young Democratic Club.\n\n In 1970 he underwent treatment for throat cancer but left the hospital for a short time to cast a crucial vote against a proposed House bill for new Vietnam War appropriations.

Lotka (1880-1949), a statistician for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, was a significant contributor to the field of demography. He was a pioneer in the study of population dynamics and conducted research on the mathematical theory of evolution and the mathematical analysis of populations. In addition to his work on demography, he published in the fields of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematical social sciences such as economics.\n\n Alfred James Lotka was born on March 2, 1880 in Lemberg, Austria (now Lviv, Ukraine) to Jacques and Marie Doebely Lotka, both American citizens. He married Romola Beattie on January 5, 1935. Lotka's early education was in France, Germany, and England. He began study at Birmingham University, England in 1898 and earned his Bachelor of Science degree in 1901. He then spent a year studying chemistry at Leipzig University from 1901 to 1902. During this period, he developed his interest in the mathematical theory of evolution, which would be the foundation for his life's work.\n\n Lotka came to the United States in 1902, where he worked as an assistant chemist at the General Chemical Company in New York until 1908. While there, he published his first papers on the mathematical theory of evolution and on population analysis. He entered Cornell University as a graduate student and assistant in physics in 1908 and received his M.A. degree in 1909.\n\n Following his education at Cornell University, Lotka worked as an examiner at the United States Patent Office (1909), assistant physicist at the United States Bureau of Standards (1909-1911), and as an editor of the Scientific American Supplement (1911-1914). He received his Doctor of Science degree from Birmingham University in 1912. Lotka then returned to General Chemical Company, where he worked as a chemist from 1914 to 1919. While he held these various positions, Lotka continued his investigations into the mathematical theory of evolution. From 1922 to 1924, he accepted a temporary research appointment in Raymond Pearl's Human Biology group at Johns Hopkins University to focus on his studies. The result of his work was the publication Elements of Physical Biology (1925).\n\n In 1924, Lotka began his employment at the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in New York City, where he would stay until he retired in 1947. He was the supervisor of mathematical research in the Statistical Bureau (1924-1933), a general supervisor (1933-1934), and an assistant statistician (1934-1947). While there, he also continued to develop the demographic analysis he had started during his undergraduate education. His book Theorie Analytique des Associations Biologiques, published in two parts in 1934 and 1939 in Paris, summarized the essentials of his work on the mathematical theory of evolution and on the mathematics of population analysis.\n\n Lotka was active in many professional organizations, serving as President of the Population Association of America (1938-1939), Vice President (1938-1939) and President (1942) of the American Statistical Association, Vice President of the International Union for the Scientific Investigation of Population Problems (1948-1949), and Chairman of the United States National Committee of the Union (1948-1949). He was a fellow of the American Public Health Association, the American Statistical Association, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and was a member of many learned societies.\n\n Throughout his career, Lotka wrote more than one hundred scientific papers, published in academic and technical journals as well as popular magazines, in the United States and abroad. His writings encompassed a wide variety of subjects, including mathematical analyses of population and the theory of evolution, actuarial mathematics applied to problems of population and industrial replacement, theoretical and applied demography, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and other mathematical social sciences such as economics. In addition to the books Elements of Physical Biology and Theorie Analytique des Associations Biologiques, which together summarize the essentials of his research, Lotka was the co-author of three books in the field of public health: The Money Value of a Man (1930), Length of Life (1936), and Twenty-five Years of Health Progress (1937). All three were co-written with Louis I. Dublin, Vice President and Statistician at the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.\n\n During his retirement, Lotka revised and translated portions of Theorie Analytique des Associations Biologiques into English. He died on December 5, 1949 in Red Bank, New Jersey."}],"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","type":"bioghist","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"704d644d54c31e28e016f5594e8d7ebc","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"Lotka's papers document his scholarship and his involvement in professional organizations and include drafts of his works, his notes and research materials, and correspondence.

Arthur Lewis (1915-1991) was a pioneer in the field of economic development and a leading authority on economic growth in developing countries and associated political and social changes. He was a professor at the University of Manchester and Princeton University and served as an advisor to several governments. Lewis, who was from the Caribbean, also broke through racial barriers in the academic world throughout his career.\n\n William Arthur Lewis was born on January 23, 1915 on the island of St. Lucia, in the Caribbean. He was the fourth of five sons born to George F. and Ida (Barton) Lewis. Both of his parents were school teachers who had immigrated to St. Lucia from Antigua. Lewis married Gladys I. Jacobs, from Grenada, in 1947. They had two daughters, Elizabeth and Barbara.\n\n Lewis won the highly competitive St. Lucia Government Scholarship in 1932, which permitted him to attend any British university. He wished to become an engineer, but knew discrimination would prevent him from finding employment. Instead, he enrolled in the Bachelor of Commerce degree program in 1933 at the London School of Economics, with the intention of returning to St. Lucia and obtaining employment in the municipal service or private trade. A portion of the degree coursework included economics classes, in which he excelled. When he graduated with his B.Com degree in 1937, the London School of Economics awarded him a scholarship to study for a Ph.D. in economics, which he received in 1940. He was appointed to a one-year teaching assistantship in 1938. In 1939, he became an assistant lecturer, a position he held until 1948. He was the first black faculty member at the school.\n\n At the London School of Economics, Lewis's mentor was Professor Sir Arnold Plant, a specialist in British industry. As a consequence, the first phase of Lewis's research career concentrated on industrial development, an area in which he continued teaching and writing until he left the London School of Economics. In 1945, the Acting Chairman of the Economics Department, Frederick Hayek, asked Lewis to develop a course on the economy between the two world wars. As a consequence, Lewis also began to change his research interests from industrial development to the study of the history of the world economy from the middle of the nineteenth century. While at the London School of Economics, Lewis also became involved in service to the British government. He was Principal of the Board of Trade in 1943, advised the British Colonial Office on economic issues in 1944, and was a member of the Colonial Economic Advisory Council from 1945 to 1949.\n\n Lewis moved to the University of Manchester in 1948, accepting the position of the Stanley Jevons Professor of Political Economy and becoming the first black professor at a British university. He remained there until 1958. While at Manchester, Lewis developed his expertise in economic development, which stemmed from his views on British colonialism. Lewis began teaching economic development regularly after 1950, in part due to the demand from the large number of students from developing countries who wanted to learn about the economies of their nations. For the rest of his career, Lewis focused on the study of economic development and continued to study the history of the world economy.\n\n While at the University of Manchester, Lewis undertook the majority of his overseas consulting projects. His first was in 1949, as an economic consultant to the Caribbean Commission to study land settlement in British Guiana and industrial development in Puerto Rico and the British West Indies. From 1950 to 1952, Lewis was director of the Colonial Development Corporation in the United Kingdom, and from 1951 to 1952 he was on the Departmental Committee on Fuel and Power, also in the United Kingdom. In 1951, Lewis was a member of the United Nations Group of Experts on Under-Developed Countries. He was a consultant for the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and Far East in 1955, and Deputy Managing Director of the United Nations Special Fund from 1959 to 1960.\n\n Lewis also traveled to Africa on several occasions during this time. He was a consultant to the Gold Coast in 1953, reporting on industrialization and the Volta River Dam Project, and also served as a consultant to the Western Nigeria government in 1955. He returned to Ghana (formerly the Gold Coast) after the country became independent, serving as economic adviser to the Prime Minister of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah, from 1957 to 1958, under the auspices of the United Nations. Lewis's role was to conduct a review of Ghana's economic and financial policies and to provide advice to government officials.\n\n In 1959, Lewis left Ghana and the University of Manchester to become the Principal of the University College of the West Indies, located in Jamaica, which was then affiliated with the University of London. In 1962, the university became an independent entity and was renamed the University of the West Indies. At that time, Lewis became the Vice-Chancellor of the university, a position he held until 1963. During his term, he widened the contacts between the community and the university, broadened the base of undergraduate recruitment, introduced new programs, and increased the number of students at the university.\n\n Lewis also served as the Special Adviser to the Prime Minister of the West Indies from 1961 to 1962. During 1962, he took a brief leave of absence from the University of the West Indies to focus his efforts on preserving the Federation of the West Indies, which he believed was critical for maintaining meaningful political independence and economic growth in the West Indies. Despite his work, the Federation was dissolved that year. Lewis was also the Director of the Central Bank of Jamaica from 1961 to 1962, and the Director of the Industrial Development Corporation in Jamaica from 1962 to 1963.\n\n Lewis returned to academia in 1963 as a professor of economics and international affairs at Princeton University, with a joint appointment in the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and the Economics Department. Lewis was the James Madison Professor of Political Economy from 1968 to 1982 and the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Economics and International Affairs from 1982 to 1983, when he retired and became professor emeritus. While at Princeton, Lewis taught undergraduate and graduate courses in economic development and modern economic history. He was also the first director, in 1967, of Princeton's interdisciplinary Research Program in Economic Development at the Woodrow Wilson School. During his career at Princeton, Lewis only took one leave of absence, to serve as a founder and the first president of the Caribbean Development Bank from 1970 to 1973. He also served as Chancellor of the University of Guyana from 1967 to 1973. It was an honorary position, for which he presided over the Council of the University and awarded degrees to graduates.\n\n Lewis was a prolific author, publishing twelve books and more than eighty monographs and articles. His important works include \"Economic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labour,\" ( Manchester Studies, 1954) and Theory of Economic Growth (1955), one of the first academic works written about economic development and considered a classic in its field. His other important works include Principles of Economic Planning (1949), Economic Survey, 1918-1939 (1949), Overhead Costs (1950), Development Planning (1966), Politics in West Africa (1966), Tropical Development, 1880-1913 (1971), and Growth and Fluctuations, 1870-1913 (1978).\n\n Lewis held leadership positions in a number of professional associations. He was president of the Manchester Statistical Society in 1956 and president of the Economic Society of Ghana in 1958. In the American Economic Association, Lewis was vice-president in 1965, elected Distinguished Fellow in 1969, and president in 1983. He was a member, fellow, or honorary fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, American Geographical Society, American Philosophical Society, British Academy, Council of the Royal Economic Society, London School of Economics and Political Science, and the Weizmann Institute. Lewis received honorary degrees from more than thirty institutions world-wide and was made a Knight Bachelor in 1963 by Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain for his service at the University of the West Indies. In 1979, Lewis was the co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economic Science, sharing the prize with Theodore W. Schultz of the University of Chicago. They were honored for their pioneering research into economic development, especially with regards to the problems of developing countries. Lewis was the first person of African descent to win the Nobel Prize for a field other than the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n Sir W. Arthur Lewis passed away in 1991 at his home in Barbados, at the age of 76.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"persistent_id":"MC092_b1","publish":true},{"type":"scopecontent","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"content":"Lewis's papers document his career as a scholar and as an economic advisor and include his professional correspondence, meeting minutes, reports, and writings.

Garfield Hays was born in Rochester, New York on December 12, 1881. His father and mother, both of German descent, belonged to prospering families in the clothing manufacturing industry. After graduating from City College of New York in 1902 and going on to receive his law degree from Columbia in 1905, Hays formed a law firm with two of his former classmates that gained prominence representing German interests in World War I.\n\n Hays was active in civil liberties issues before becoming general counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union in 1920. From this point one can recognize the emergence of what many have called Hays's \"dual personality,\" in which he became a wealthy lawyer who represented the interests of power and fame (his more prominent clients ranged from Wall Street brokers and best-selling authors to notorious gamblers and the Dionne quintuplets)--while at the same time rigorously defending the individual liberty of victims of discriminatory laws.\n\n The list of famous cases in which Hays took part is lengthy, including the Scopes trial (often called the \"monkey trial\") in 1925 in which a school teacher in Tennessee was tried for teaching evolution; the Sacco and Vanzetti case in which two Italian anarchists in Boston were put to death in 1927 for a murder they denied committing; and the Scottsboro case where eight black men from Alabama were condemned to die in 1931 for allegedly attacking two white women. Hays also attended the Reichstag trial in Berlin on behalf of Georgi Dmitrov, a Bulgarian Communist tried by Nazis in 1933 for burning the Reichstag.\n\n In addition to his work as a lawyer, Hays wrote an astounding number of books and articles. As a gifted writer and eloquent debater, he added his perspective to virtually every individual rights issue of his day. His autobiography, entitled City Lawyer: the Autobiography of a Law Practice (1942), provides a colorful account of his more noteworthy cases, and his articles and book reviews demonstrate his wide-ranging knowledge of a nation and a world experiencing dramatic change in the way individual rights were perceived.\n\n Hays married Blanche Marks in 1908 and divorced her in 1924. They had one daughter, Mrs. Lora Spindell. He married Aline Davis Fleisher in 1924, who died in 1944. They also had a daughter, Mrs. Jane Butler. After more than four decades at the center of the individual rights debate, Hays died of a heart attack on December 14, 1954.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true}],"type":"bioghist","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"ee328798fb435677276a5f36a9d306f9","type":"scopecontent","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"Consists of correspondence, case files, speeches, articles, books, news clippings, and photographs which document Hays's career as a New York City lawyer and general counsel for the ACLU beginning in 1920.

Greenbaum (1890-1970) was a lawyer in New York City in the legal firm of Greenbaum, Wolff &amp; Ernst who was involved in court reform efforts throughout his career. He also served in the War Department during World War II as executive officer to Under Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson, negotiating contracts with the private sector for munitions and supplies.\n\n Edward Samuel Greenbaum was born in New York City on April 13, 1890. He was the second son of Samuel Greenbaum, who became a New York State Supreme Court Justice in 1900. Greenbaum studied at the Horace Mann School and then attended Williams College, where he received his A.B. in 1910. He earned his law degree (LL.B.) from Columbia University in 1913. Edward Greenbaum married Dorothea Schwarcz, a sculptor, in October 1920 and they had two sons: Daniel and David.\n\n Greenbaum began to practice law in 1913 in New York City with his older brother Lawrence and Herbert A. Wolff, a classmate. In 1915, they were joined by Morris L. Ernst and founded the firm of Greenbaum, Wolff &amp; Ernst. Lawrence Greenbaum died in 1951 and the other three men continued the firm. Greenbaum choose not to specialize, instead staying involved with many areas of the law. He tried cases, argued appeals, conducted family counseling, worked for corporations, and administered estates. Greenbaum, Wolff &amp; Ernst became one of New York's most prominent law firms and was well-respected in literary and civil-liberties legal circles.\n\n Greenbaum interrupted his practice of law to serve the United States when America entered World War I. He was unable to qualify for officers' training at the citizens' training camp in Plattsburgh, N.Y. because of color blindness, so he enlisted as a private. During training at Camp Upton, he created and ran a program to teach English to immigrant soldiers. On February 6, 1918, he was promoted to the rank of captain. Greenbaum was later made a major in the Judge Advocate's Department and served in Germany for several months. He served in the military from 1917 to 1919 and then returned to his law practice.\n\n In the 1920s, Greenbaum became increasingly involved in public affairs. He joined a group at the John's Hopkins Institute for the Study of Law that was studying the civil litigation system in the fall of 1928. He became chairman of the committee of nine lawyers working with the institute on the study in 1929. This work was the beginning of his life-long pursuit for court reform.\n\n Greenbaum was called into active service in World War II, commissioned as a lieutenant colonel in 1940 and rising to the rank of brigadier general in March 1943. He served as executive officer to Under Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson from 1941 to 1946. Greenbaum worked as a lawyer for the War Department, negotiating contracts with private industry, and was instrumental in ensuring that there were sufficient munitions and supplies for the war. Because of his work, he became known for his ability to work out satisfactory compromises between groups of conflicting people. Greenbaum also shaped the War Department's labor policies. He received the Distinguished Service Medal in 1945.\n\n Following his service in the War Department, Greenbaum again returned to his law practice at Greenbaum, Wolff &amp; Ernst. He also continued his efforts to improve the organization of the court system, serving as chairman for many professional groups studying court reform and helping to establish the Citizens Committee for Modern Courts in 1955. He played a major role in establishing an Adolescent Court in New York as head of a New York Law Society study, and in the 1950s was part of the efforts that culminated in the first major New York state and local court reforms in 115 years, instituted in 1960 and 1961.\n\n During the course of his career, Greenbaum worked on many prominent cases. He served as trustee for the American estate of Ivar Kreuger when his company, Kreuger &amp; Toll, declared bankruptcy in the 1930s, and also served as special assistant to the United States Attorney General from 1934 to 1938. While he served the Attorney General, Greenbaum prosecuted banker Charles E. Mitchell for income tax evasion. Governor Thomas E. Dewey appointed Greenbaum to serve as chief counsel for the commission to reorganize the Long Island Rail Road after a series of accidents in 1950, and Greenbaum represented Harper &amp; Row Publishers when Jacqueline Kennedy withdrew her support for the publication of The Death of a President by William Manchester in 1966. Greenbaum's most famous case is generally considered to be serving as legal counsel to Svetlana Alliluyeva, Stalin's daughter, when she published her book Twenty Letters to a Friend and subsequently serving as her mentor when she came to the United States in 1967.\n\n In addition to his career as a lawyer, Greenbaum was active in his community. He was a founder of the Jewish Big Brothers, which aids troubled youth, and served as trustee of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. Greenbaum also continued to serve the government. In 1933, he was appointed chairman of the Alcohol Control Commission, created by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to establish Federal codes to control liquor after the repeal of the Prohibition Amendment, and in 1958 he was a member of the New Jersey Department of Institutions and Agencies Study Commission. Greenbaum also served as the alternate United States delegate at the 1956-1957 United Nations General Assembly, where he presented the United States call for Korean unity.\n\n Additionally, Greenbaum was a very active member in the American, City of New York, and New York State bar associations. He was co-author of The King's Bench Masters with Leslie I. Reade, published in 1932. Greenbaum's autobiography, A Lawyer's Job, was published in 1967. He received an honorary Doctor of Letters in 1946, and the Rogerson Cup and Medal in 1957, from Williams College. The Cup and Medal is given to an alumnus or senior for service and loyalty to the college and for distinction in any field. It was given to Greenbaum for his ability to negotiate acceptable compromises in difficult situations between conflicting parties. Greenbaum died on June 12, 1970.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"persistent_id":"MC069_b1","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true,"content":"Greenbaum's papers document his career as a lawyer, as well as his government service, and include correspondence, legal documents, reports, and publications.

He was an expert on foreign exchange, and during World War I and its aftermath was involved with establishing foreign exchange policies, reparations, and war debt. Kent was also active in numerous organizations, including the American Bankers Association and the International Chamber of Commerce.\n\n Kent was born Frederick I. Kent on February 12, 1869 in Chicago, Illinois to Henry and Julia Kent. He was educated in the public schools of Chicago and never attended college, choosing instead to leave high school and seek employment. He married Etta G. Williams of Boston, Massachusetts on April 18, 1891.\n\n He began his banking career in 1886, at the age of seventeen, as a clerk at the First National Bank of Chicago. He was steadily promoted until he became manager of the Foreign Exchange Department in 1905. Kent also became active with the American Bankers Association during this period. He was the first president of the Chicago chapter of what would become the American Institute of Banking, and the first national president of the Institute. The Institute provided distance-learning classes and published materials for the continuing education of individuals in the field of finance.\n\n Kent's work with foreign exchange earned him recognition in the financial world. In January 1909, he accepted the position of vice-president of the Bankers Trust Company in New York City, where he was placed in charge of organizing the Foreign Exchange Department. He also continued his work with the American Bankers Association, coordinating the development of the Travellers' Check System of the Association and serving as chairman of the Committee of the Express Money Order Department.\n\n Kent was in Europe at the outbreak of World War I and organized and directed efforts to provide stranded Americans with the funds and transportation necessary to return to the United States. The recognition he gained from this work, and his expertise in international finance, led to his appointment as deputy governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1917, and later as director of the division of foreign exchange of the Federal Reserve Board. In this capacity, he assisted in establishing a system of foreign exchange between the Allied countries. During this period, he also served as financial adviser to the director of sales of the War Department and as representative of the United States on the organization committee of the Reparations Commission to Paris. Following the war, he assisted in the stabilization of exchange and settlement of money problems of several European countries, especially with regards to reparations and debt payments. Kent received many honors for his work in Europe after World War I, including Chevalier, and a later promotion to Officer, of the Legion of Honor in France, Commander of the Crown of Italy, and Commander in the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus in Italy.\n\n After the war, Kent returned to his position as vice-president at the Bankers Trust Company. He stepped down from this post in 1928, but continued as director until his death in 1954. He resigned from his position as vice-president in order to devote more time to a number of semi-public organizations that he was associated with, especially the International Chamber of Commerce. He also became chairman of the Commerce and Marine Commission of the American Bankers Association, a position he held until 1954.\n\n Kent was elected to the Council of New York University in 1929, after having served as chairman of the advisory board of the Wall Street Center of New York University since its establishment. The Council serves as the university's board of trustees. Kent became president of the Council in 1931 and chairman of the Council in 1951. He served as chairman until his death.\n\n Throughout his life, Kent was the director of several corporations, including the Bankers Trust Company and the National Industrial Conference Board. He was also an officer or member of a large number of semi-public organizations, including national commerce, industry and trade groups, banking groups, economic, political and social science organizations, and the International Chamber of Commerce. Kent was frequently a speaker on financial matters, especially in venues where foreign trade relations were discussed. He received an honorary LL.D. from the University of Southern California in 1930, and was awarded the Robert Dollar award for his work in foreign trade by the National Foreign Trade Council in 1945. Kent died on October 25, 1954 at the age of 85.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"publish":true},{"persistent_id":"e35a21579d9006769dbaae2248713958","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","type":"scopecontent","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"content":"Kent's papers include his correspondence with businessmen and politicians about financial and economic issues, articles and speeches written by Kent, and papers documenting his involvement with several banking and economic organizations.

The company was organized as a giant pyramid scheme and went bankrupt in 1932. The company consisted of over 250 subsidiaries, the two largest being the Swedish Match Company, based in Stockholm, and its American subsidiary, the International Match Corporation. Kreuger &amp; Toll also granted millions of dollars in loans to European and South American governments in need of funds following World War I in return for match monopolies or other trade concessions.\n\n Kreuger (1880-1932) was a Swedish civil engineer who worked first in the United States and then in Sweden, specializing in building with steel and concrete and speculating in real estate. He earned a reputation as a shrewd and reliable businessman, which later allowed him to obtain credit in almost any country. He took over his father's small match-making factory in 1913, and also at that time formed the construction engineering firm of Kreuger &amp; Toll with a partner, Paul Toll. They soon merged the match company into Kreuger &amp; Toll. Paul Toll only participated in the operations of the engineering branch of the firm, while Kreuger began to seek control of the Swedish match industry. Kreuger controlled the company and made all the important decisions for Kreuger &amp; Toll throughout the company's history. Difficulties experienced by the Swedish match industry due to competition from foreign factories allowed Kreuger &amp; Toll to acquire control of eleven independent factories under the firm the United Swedish Match Factories. Pressure from the export slump caused by World War I allowed for further acquisitions. The company soon gained control of the entire Swedish match industry under the holding company the Swedish Match Company, which was formed in 1917 as a subsidiary of Kreuger &amp; Toll.\n\n Following World War I, Kreuger &amp; Toll began to expand beyond Sweden, acquiring factories throughout Europe, as well as shares in paper mills, forests and logging rights, machine-making workshops, and chlorate of potash factories, controlling the production of matches from the raw materials through to the finished product. The company grew to own or control approximately 250 factories in 43 countries in Europe, North and South America, and Asia. By 1928, Kreuger &amp; Toll controlled more than half of the world's match production, which increased to 90% by the end of 1930. Kreuger &amp; Toll also ultimately included a pulp company, a gold mine, an iron company, a telephone company, shares in a real estate enterprise, and a chain of banks and investing companies throughout Europe.\n\n Kreuger &amp; Toll formed the International Match Corporation in the United States in 1923, and transferred the majority of its European factories to this daughter company. After that, most international activity was carried out through the International Match Corporation. However, the corporation remained under Swedish control. Directors were largely Swedish, with Kreuger as the head. Swedish control over Kreuger &amp; Toll was preserved through the sale of two types of shares. The A shares, with full voting rights, could only be sold in Sweden. The B shares sold to foreign investors only carried 1 vote for every 1,000 shares.\n\n Kreuger &amp; Toll expanded beyond match production, granting millions of dollars in loans to European and South American governments in need of funds following World War I. In return for the loans, Kreuger &amp; Toll received a match monopoly or other trade concessions, eventually acquiring monopolies in fifteen countries and concessions in many others. The loans redistributed capital around the globe in a way that governments had been unable achieve. Kreuger was hailed as a financial genius by some of the most distinguished economists and financiers of the time, and was lauded as the \"Savior of Europe\" and even the \"Savior of the World.\" He was knighted by France, became an advisor to presidents and kings and a frequent visitor to President Herbert Hoover's White House, served as a peacemaker for the League of Nations at the Hague, and was suggested as a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n Kreuger &amp; Toll loaned more than $300 million to foreign governments, typically through the International Match Corporation. The funds were obtained from investors, largely the American public, through the sale of Kreuger &amp; Toll securities and the securities of its subsidiaries. The securities were very popular, especially with small investors, because they were issued in small denominations and had high, regular dividends, over 20% annually. Kreuger &amp; Toll stocks and bonds were the most-widely held securities in the United States and throughout the world during the 1920s. However, dividends were so high because by 1924 they were largely paid out of capital instead of from profit. Later investigation of the company's finances concluded that dividends of only 1.5% were justified by the profits of the match industry. To raise sufficient funds to provide loans for governments, Kreuger needed to induce higher sales of Kreuger &amp; Toll securities, which he achieved through increasing dividends. Capital from the purchase of new securities was also required to pay the interest and dividends on outstanding securities. The system depended on the constant input of new capital, essentially a giant pyramid scheme.\n\n When the stock market crashed in 1929, Kreuger &amp; Toll securities continued to sell well, and unlike other corporations it never suspended dividend or interest payments. In fact, since its dividends were not based on profit, the Depression did not initially effect the company. However, as the legitimate businesses of Kreuger &amp; Toll began making less money and investors had less money to purchase new stocks, Kreuger &amp; Toll began to experience financial difficulties, as there was not enough new capital being invested to sustain the pyramid scheme. Also at that time, Kreuger made loans to Germany, Poland, and took a share of the Young loan, over-extending the company's finances. In an effort to recover, he put large sums into Paris real estate, pawned assets, and finally forged Italian State bonds with a face value of 21 million pounds, hoping to use them to bolster his credit, but he was unable to rectify the company's financial problems. Ivar Kreuger committed suicide on March 12, 1932. Initially, the world mourned him as a victim of the Depression.\n\n After Kreuger's death, the accounting firm Price, Waterhouse &amp; Co. examined the finances of Kreuger &amp; Toll to determine if it was viable to continue as a company without the founder, and the auditors quickly began to uncover Kreuger &amp; Toll's true financial state. They discovered a quarter of a billion dollars in reported assets had never existed. In addition to the many legitimate businesses of Kreuger &amp; Toll, many were only shell corporations. Some were created in small European countries to avoid income taxes, and others had been created to generate profits on paper to allow high dividend payments. The company was declared bankrupt in Sweden on May 24, 1932 and in the United States on August 6, 1932, the largest bankruptcy on record at that time. Thousands of investors, university endowment funds, and banks lost hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n Kreuger had been able to keep his financial manipulations secret because he never permitted an audit of the company while he was alive. Kreuger maintained that the only information investors needed was a corporation's dividend policy. If any investment bankers demanded an audited balance sheet, Kreuger refused to deal with them, and because of the high demand and high dividends of Kreuger &amp; Toll's securities, no investment banker was willing to risk that loss. Investors instead based their purchasing decisions on dividend payments, the reputation of Ivar Kreuger, and the prestige of the brokerage firm Lee, Higginson &amp; Company that had underwritten the American securities. Kreuger was further protected by a corporate culture of secrecy practiced by many firms at that time. Kreuger even maintained secrecy within the organization. The subsidiaries were financially linked but administratively isolated, ensuring that only Kreuger was controlling the company as a whole. He revealed little even to his directors, who did not attend directors' meetings or receive financial reports. Indeed, the company kept relatively few financial records. Later court testimony revealed that Kreuger prepared the financial statements issued by his companies without reference to any statistics or ledgers, and had his accountants create books to match those financial statements.\n\n Price, Waterhouse &amp; Co. was retained as an impartial fact-finder and conducted a thorough investigation of all of the Kreuger &amp; Toll companies. The location and distribution of the majority of the company's assets was handled by a Swedish committee of five liquidators. Assets in the United States were managed by a trustee, first Gordon Auchincloss and then, beginning on February 18, 1933, Edward S. Greenbaum. In addition to creditors, the subsidiaries also made substantial claims against Kreuger &amp; Toll and each other. The internal affairs of the company were difficult to decipher due to Kreuger's manipulations of the assets between Kreuger &amp; Toll, subsidiaries and himself, and conflicting, sometimes fraudulent, books. Swedish Match Company was one of the few principle companies able to avoid bankruptcy. Claims between Kreuger &amp; Toll companies were settled in 1936, and the final payments of dividends to the holders of Kreuger &amp; Toll securities were made in 1938.\n\n Within two months of the bankruptcy, there were calls in the United States for legislation to prevent frauds of a similar nature. Federal securities legislation had been considered in Congress since 1918, and the public outcry and media coverage of the Kreuger &amp; Toll fraud provided some of the impetus to finally pass the laws. In 1933, the first securities act was passed.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"MC078_b1","publish":true},{"type":"scopecontent","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"content":"The Kreuger &amp; Toll Company Records document the company's bankruptcy and include court and legal documents and accountants' reports.

Spahr was a founding member and officer of the Economists' National Committee for Monetary Policy, which advocated for sound monetary policies for the United States. He also served as a consultant to industry, banks, organizations, and members of Congress.\n\n Walter Earl Spahr was born on June 27, 1891 in Centerville, Indiana to Isaac and Thursa Spahr. He married Beulah Evelyn Lowry from Washington, Pennsylvania on August 25, 1920. They had three children: Carol (Bogdassarian), Kenneth, and Jean (Segatto). Spahr earned his A.B. in history from Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana in 1914 and then taught as an instructor in history at Pacific College in Newberg, Oregon from 1914 to 1915. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley in the summer of 1915 before taking a job as instructor of economic history at Manual Training High School in Indianapolis from 1915 to 1916. He enrolled in graduate school at the University of Wisconsin, while also working as assistant instructor in political science, from 1916 to 1917. He received his M.A. in government in 1917 and then was drafted into the United States army. Spahr served from 1917 to 1918 at Camp Taylor, Kentucky in a training battalion as battalion clerk and instructor in charge of army paper work at the division school. Spahr was discharged with the rank of sergeant.\n\n Following his military service, Spahr returned to teaching. He was professor of political science and history, and head of the Department of History and Government, at Muskingum College in New Concord, Ohio from 1918 to 1919. In the summer of 1919, he pursued graduate study in the field of economics at Columbia before becoming an instructor of economics at Dartmouth from 1919 to 1920. He returned to Columbia in 1920, where he was instructor of economics from 1920 to 1923 while studying for his Ph.D. in economics, which he received in 1925. Spahr also began teaching on the faculty of the New York City Chapter of the American Institute of Banking in 1920 as an instructor in economics, money, and banking. He continued teaching there until 1928.\n\n Spahr began his career at New York University as assistant professor of economics in 1923 and was promoted to associate professor of economics in 1926. In 1927, he became associate professor of money and banking and acting chairman of the Department of Economics. He also taught for a semester at Princeton University that year as a visiting associate professor of public finance. He became a full professor of economics and chairman of the Department of Economics at New York University in 1928, holding both positions until he retired professor emeritus in 1956.\n\n In addition to his academic career, Spahr was a founder of the Economists' National Committee on Monetary Policy (hereafter \"the Committee\") in 1933 and remained the driving force behind the Committee for the rest of his life. The Committee was formed in opposition to the United States government's New Deal monetary policies and campaigned for a return to the gold standard and limits on inflation. The Committee sought to educate the public and United States government on the monetary issues facing the country and members frequently testified before Congress. Spahr served as Secretary-Treasurer (1933-1945) and as Executive Vice President and Treasurer (1946-1970) of the Committee. Spahr was also the editor and author of Monetary Notes (1940-1970), the Committee's monthly newsletter that was sent to Congress, leading Federal administrators, and major newspapers and radio commentators. The Committee continued its work until 1970, when it was dissolved after Spahr's death.\n\n Spahr also served as a consultant and conducted research studies on economics issues for industry, banks, organizations, and members of Congress. He represented state chambers of commerce before Congress, conducted studies for the munitions industry, and consulted for members of both political parties of both houses of Congress. He was director and economist for the New York Air Brake Company, trustee of the Tax Foundation of New York, and director of the Citizen's National Committee.\n\n Spahr was a prolific author and speaker, with the Economists' National Committee on Monetary Policy publishing many of his works. He was also published in academic journals and utilized newspapers and radio to reach the American people. He criticized the New Deal, advocated for the gold standard, and argued for policies that minimized government interference in business. Spahr was a member of the Stable Money Association, the Money and Banking Committee of the Commerce and Industry Association in New York, the American Economics Association, the American Academy of Political and Social Science, and the American Statistics Association. He was awarded the Alvin T. Simonds Economic Prize from the Simonds Saw &amp; Steel Company in 1929, the Master Prophecy Award from Newsweek magazine in 1939, and the Freedom Foundation award in 1949. Spahr died on January 19, 1970."}],"publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","type":"scopecontent","subnotes":[{"content":"Spahr's papers document his scholarship and include his writings and related correspondence.

He became a special assistant to the U.S. ambassador in Tehran in 1944, and served as a counselor for economic affairs at the American embassy in Cairo, and for American diplomatic missions in Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Ethiopia over the course of his career. From 1955 until his retirement in 1961, he served as director of the Foreign Service Institute.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"type":"bioghist","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","persistent_id":"MC221_b1","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","type":"scopecontent","subnotes":[{"content":"The Harold B.

(Saben) Twitchell (born in St. Albans, Vermont on June 7, 1885) was an American mining engineer and geologist who conducted extensive mineral surveys in the Middle East between 1927 and the 1950s. He attended Kingston School of Mines, Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario and graduated with a BS in 1908 and an ME in 1909. Between 1908 and 1915, Twitchell worked as an assayer, surveyor, prospector, and engineer in California, Idaho, and Arizona for various British and American companies, including Delamar Ltd. While working in a copper mine in Arizona, Twitchell met Colonel Seeley W. Mudd, who offered Twitchell an opportunity to work on developing the Skouriotissa Gold Mine in Cyprus in 1915. This pivotal early project ultimately led to a variety of mining projects in Portugal, Abyssinia (present day Ethiopia), Iran, and British Guiana. Twitchell's most significant work, however, took place in Yemen and Saudi Arabia.\n\n As a gift to Imam Yahiz, businessman Charles R. Crane hired Twitchell to survey mine resources, develop transportation infrastructure, and conduct agricultural experiments in Yemen during the later 1920s and early 1930s. Based on his successes in Yemen, a similar arrangement for surveying water resources, later to include mineral and oil surveying, was negotiated in 1932 for King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia. On behalf of Standard Oil Company of California, Twitchell negotiated the first ever oil concession with the Saudi Arabian government in May 1933. With negotiations successfully completed, Twitchell began developing Mahad Dhahab and other mines in Saudi Arabia on behalf of the newly formed Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate, which later included and was managed by the American Smelting and Refining Company. Other professional projects during this time include exploration and development of Placer Diamond Mine in British Guiana, serving as Vice President and consultant for American Eastern Corporation, consulting in Iran as part of its \"Seven Year Plan,\" and leading the Agricultural Mission to Saudi Arabia in 1943-1944.\n\n As an American businessman with a strong connection to the Middle East, Twitchell was involved with several philanthropic and academic organizations which had an interest in the region, including American Middle East Relief, Council on Islamic Affairs, Committee for Security and Justice in the Middle East, and Princeton University's Department of Oriental Languages and Literature Graduate Advisory Council. Often such affiliations reflected Twitchell's interest in the region's social and political circumstances, particularly if events impacted American-Saudi Arabian business relations. Twitchell also served on the Boards of Directors for American Eastern and Rock of Ages Corporations.\n\n As a result of his experience and interest in the Middle East, Twitchell wrote many articles and a book, Saudi Arabia, published by Princeton University Press in 1947. Dodd, Mead and Company published a second book, Keith Arnold in Mining, in 1955."}],"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true,"content":"The Karl S.

Goheen, a doctor, and his mother Anne Goheen-Ewing, a teacher, were Presbyterian missionaries. In 1934, Goheen moved to the United States to finish his high school education at the Lawrenceville School, in Lawrenceville, New Jersey. Graduating with honors after two years, he entered Princeton University as member of the Class of 1940. Princeton was a logical choice: his brother, Richard '36, had just graduated from Princeton, and their grandfather, Joseph M. Goheen, also a Presbyterian missionary in India, was a member of the Class of 1872.\n\n Goheen was an all-around Princetonian. He was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, as well as an avid soccer player on the varsity team. Other memberships included the political and debating club Whig-Clio, the Quadrangle Eating Club, of which he was president, and the Inter-Club Committee. In 1940 he graduated in the Special Program in Humanities and Classics. His senior thesis was about the nature and object of tragedy, an interest he would continue to pursue academically. Upon graduation, he received the M. Taylor Pyne Honor Prize, the highest general distinction conferred upon an undergraduate.\n\n Goheen started as a graduate student at Princeton University in September 1940, holding a Junior Fellowship in Classics for the academic year. His graduate studies, however, were interrupted by the Second World War. Goheen joined the army in October 1941, three months after marrying Margaret M. Skelly of Wilmington, Delaware. Although he joined the Infantry as a Second Lieutenant, he was first employed at the Military Intelligence Service of the War Department in Washington, DC. In April 1943 he joined the First Cavalry Division. He served oversees as a research analyst until July 1945, supervising the preparation of strategic intelligence reports on the Pacific Islands; during his last year as Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence he held the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.\n\n When he returned to civilian life, Goheen, now a father of two, was one of the first four recipients of a Woodrow Wilson fellowship, established at Princeton to enable war veterans to consider a career in teaching. Complementing this, the Department of Classics employed him as a part-time preceptor and tutor. Goheen received his MA in 1947 and PhD 1948. His dissertation The Imagery of Sophocles' Antigone (a Study of Poetic Language and Structure) was published by Princeton University Press in 1951.\n\n Goheen continued teaching as an instructor in Classics until his appointment as assistant professor of Classics in 1950. When he was elected President of Princeton University in December 1956, he would be the youngest president in Princeton's history since the eighteenth century. He had only just started to establish a reputation as a classicist, holding a bicentennial preceptorship in 1951-1954, which enabled him to spend a year at the American Academy in Rome.\n\n One reason Goheen was elected President was his experience as National Director of the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship Program, a half-time position, which he combined with half-time teaching in 1953-1956. The program had grown since 1945, when Goheen had been a Woodrow Wilson fellow himself. Sponsored by the American Association of Universities and receiving substantial funding from many foundations, the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship Program paved the way for Goheen's presidency as well as his post-presidential career in the area of foundations and philanthropy.\n\n When Goheen retired as President in 1972, he could look back upon fifteen years in which he led Princeton University through a process of growth and change. During his presidency the University had substantially increased its physical plant, as well as its student enrollment, faculty, and staff, while alumni contributions more than doubled, and the annual budget quadrupled. Faced with the social and political challenges of the Sixties, Goheen encouraged student involvement in decision-making processes and initiated active recruitment of minorities and, in 1969, the admission of women, which was particularly criticized by conservative alumni.\n\n After the American invasion of Cambodia, student protests culminated in a general strike; Goheen himself spoke to the assembly of students, faculty and staff on May 4, 1970. Many attributed the wisdom and flexibility of Goheen's administration for avoiding the violence and civil unrest that afflicted campuses nationwide.\n\n After announcing his retirement in 1972, Goheen had many options to choose from; he accepted the position of President of the Council on Foundations in New York. Founded in 1949, the foundation, with a board of 35 people, provided program consultation for its five hundred member foundations. Goheen stated he was convinced that private philanthropy in general and charitable foundations in particular were \"critical elements in the diversity, openness and innovative character of the American society.\"\n\n In January 1977 Goheen became president of the $160 million Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, established to improve conditions for dispossessed children, the institutionalized poor, and the developing world. Less than five months later, however, President Jimmy Carter appointed him U.S. Ambassador to India, the country where he had lived the first fifteen years of his life.\n\n As an Ambassador, Goheen became immersed in nuclear issues. India had detonateded its first nuclear device in 1974, eleven years after the United States had signed a 30-year contract to deliver enriched uranium fuel to generate nuclear power. President Carter wanted Goheen to secure India's commitment to stop testing and start a dialogue with the U.S. On January 3, 1978, two months before Congress passed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978, Prime Minister Moraji Desai and Jimmy Carter signed a joint declaration aiming to reduce the threat of nuclear war and to bridge the gap between rich and poor nations.\n\n Goheen held the Ambassadorship until December 1980, when he returned to Princeton to become Senior Fellow of Public and International Affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School. He also worked for the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, directing the Andrew W. Mellon Fellowship Program in the Humanities.\n\n Thus, almost forty years after a Woodrow Wilson fellowship enabled his own career as a scholar and teacher, Goheen was back in the humanities. Senior humanists were \"hungry,\" according to him, to encourage the ablest young people to \"continue in the humanities and not be deflected, as so many have been recently, into law, business, and other professions.\" Goheen had been one of the founders of the National Humanities Center in North Carolina in 1978, and had served as a trustee. Twenty years later he was honored for his role with the establishment of the annual Robert and Margaret S. Goheen Fellowship at the Center.\n\n Amongst the many honors for his service to the humanities are the Robert F. Goheen Professorship in the Humanities at Princeton (1986) and the annual Robert F. Goheen Prize in Classical Studies (Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, 1992).\n\n Robert Goheen died in 2008 at age 88.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","publish":true},{"type":"scopecontent","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The Robert F.

Holbrooke was an American diplomat who led negotiations at the Dayton Accords for peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1995, brokering the agreement to end the Bosnian war.\n\n Holbrooke was born in New York City in 1941. He attended Brown University, became editor of the Brown Daily Herald and graduated in 1962. He joined the Foreign Service, was posted to Vietnam's Mekong Delta and later to Saigon, and subsequently worked on Lyndon Johnson's White House group of staff on Vietnam. He attended the Paris peace talks on Vietnam with the American delegation in 1968.\n\n In 1969-1970, Holbrooke spent a year at Princeton University as a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. He served as Peace Corps director in Morocco from 1970 to 1972, returning to the U.S. to edit Foreign Policy magazine from 1972 to 1976. During the Carter administration, Holbrooke was assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. In between Democratic administrations, Holbrooke helped found the consulting firm Public Strategies and worked in investment banking at Lehman Brothers.\n\n Under Bill Clinton, Holbrooke was United States ambassador to Germany from 1993 to 1994, and helped to found the American Academy in Berlin while he was there. He served as assistant secretary of state for European and Canadian Affairs from 1994 to 1995, necessitating a focus on the crisis in the Balkans. Holbrooke's memoir To End a War (1998) recounts his experience of the negotiations between the leaders of Croatia, Bosnia, and Serbia at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio in 1995.\n\n Holbrooke served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations from 1999 to 2001, achieving a settlement of U.S. debt to the United Nations and a UN Security Council resolution on HIV and AIDS. He was foreign policy adviser to Hillary Clinton's campaign for president, and served the Obama administration as special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan from 2009 to 2010.

His parents exposed him to travel at an early age--an affinity that was to be both vocation and avocation for the rest of his life.\n\n Following his Princeton graduation in 1910, Hall and his mother drove their Packard automobile on a 45,000 mile odyssey around the world. Several of Hall's articles describing that trip were published by the National Geographic Magazine and the events of the journey are documented in Journey to the End of an Era (1947) and in Bird of Time (1949).\n\n At the outbreak of World War I Hall was in France. He volunteered his services to the British Expeditionary Forces and before the entrance of the United States into the war, fought with the French, Belgian and English armies.\n\n At the instigation of Col. William \"Billy\" Mitchell he transferred to the U.S. Army in 1917, where he worked closely with Mitchell on the formation of the U.S. Air Corps. He believed, as did Mitchell, in the need to build a superior defensive air power. In 1918 Hall was cited for organizing the first American Escadrille for night reconnaissance. He was wounded twice, four times decorated by three different countries and was cited ten times for gallant and distinguished service. His decorations include the Croix de Guerre with Palm from both France and Belgium, and the D.S.O. from Great Britain. He and Mitchell are among only six men honored by an Act of Congress with the rank Military Aviator.\n\n After the war Hall spent three years in London as Assistant Military Attache for Aviation. In 1922 he met and married Josephine Wells Johnson, the daughter of Racine, Wisconsin banker Otis W. Johnson, who had been a field nurse during the war. After their marriage in Paris, the couple left for Persia where Hall joined Arthur Chester Millspaugh's staff as a provincial administrator for the American Financial Mission. During his five years with the Mission, Hall served as Administrator of Finances for East Persia (the provinces of Khorasan, Seistan and Ghayenat), as Acting Treasurer-General of the delegation, and as Administrator of Finances for South Persia (Fars and the Southern Ports). In those positions he was responsible for monitoring activities of the nomadic tribes, taxation, road and railroad construction, investigation of opium traffic for the League of Nations, and the administration of the Anglo-Persian oil fields in Khuzistan.\n\n Following his Persian experience Hall worked as Vice President in charge of European and Asiatic Affairs for the Curtiss-Wright Aeroplane Export Co. While there, he established an airline for the Turkish government, oversaw the reequipping of the Netherlands Air Force, and demonstrated aircraft in twenty countries.\n\n Hall's civilian career spanned the years 1933-1940, when he worked for the Export-Import Bank, Washington, D.C.; as a special advisor on foreign trade for the President; for Sears and for the Diesel Division of Caterpillar Co., and as Chief of the Foreign Economic Section of the Civil Aeronautics Authority.\n\n With another war in Europe imminent, Hall again sought military involvement. He was recommissioned a Lieutenant Commander, United States Naval Reserve in 1939, and when Pearl Harbor was attacked, was serving as a naval attache in Istanbul. He resigned his naval commission in 1942 to accept a commission as Lt. Colonel in the Army Air Corps. By 1943 he served as Chief of Staff of the 9th Air Force. A shattered knee at the Normandy landing ended his military career, which covered both world wars and branches of the service.\n\n After the war Hall authored two autobiographical books filled with picaresque characters and remarkable adventures. In 1951 Walter Bedell Smith, then Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, sent Hall to Indochina as Chief of a special mission attached to the Ambassador to Vietnam and Cambodia. In 1955, Hall reflected that events in Vietnam would ‘inevitably affect the concern of America in world evolution,’ (Correspondence, Aug 19, 1955).\n\n Colonel and Mrs. Hall retired to \"La Grangeotte,\" their 14th- century residence in Vezelay, France. He was an active member of La Confrerie des Chevaliers du Tastevin, a French wine-tasting society and continued writing on a wide variety of subjects. Included in his papers is a draft of a book on the 12th century pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela, Spain--a thousand mile journey which Hall traced by jeep, some 50 years after his Princeton graduation.\n\n Hall died in the Veterans Administration Hospital in New York City, on November 23, 1962.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"type":"bioghist","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","persistent_id":"MC159_b1","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"4ee46e6e317851a0c0b05b5749412e5c","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","type":"scopecontent","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"Consists of diaires, correspondence, published and unpublished writings, medals, awards, photographs, and scrapbooks of Hall (Princeton Univerrsity Class of 1910). The collection contains diaries Hall kept throughout his life which chronicle his travels and his reflections on transportation conditions; personal and business correspondence; official documents and reports from his tenure with the American Financial Mission to Persia (1922-1927) which reflect his work as a provincial administrator. (Many of these documents are in Farsi, and several are in French; most are dated in the Iranian calendar.) There are copies of his published writings including JOURNEY TO THE END OF AN ERA, which describes a 45,000 mile motor trip around the world (1912-1913), and BIRD OF TIME, which contains reminiscences of his travels, experience in World War I, and life in Vezelay, France. Photographs document Hall's world travels and his activities in Persia and during World War I when he served as a U.S. Army Air Corps officer. Included are records of his military service, appointments, awards, citations, and medals.\n\n Hall's diaries are detailed and especially valuable for their observations on international travel and transportation conditions. They reflect his fascination with the automobile and aeroplane. Aviation, and his belief in its potential for both defense and commerce, was a life-long commitment. Letters to his family contain analyses of political and social factors in countries where he traveled and was stationed. His assessments and predictions concerning World War II, and later, the future of Indochina, are astute.\n\n Of particular interest are the materials which devolve from Hall's work as a provincial administrator with the American Financial Mission to Persia (1922-1927). Many of these official documents are in Farsi, and several are in French; most are dated in the Iranian calendar. The American Financial Mission paid particular attention to the census value of tax rolls, and the documents contain lists of names and tribal organization charts. Details of agricultural production and land use, observations on uprisings, information on oil concession, the opium trade and pearl fishing industry, and comments on the political regime are highlighted.","publish":true}],"publish":true},{"persistent_id":"7c50a2fff8b7e84eaf68d10e6d7901a2","subnotes":[{"content":"Collection is open for research use.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","type":"accessrestrict","rights_restriction":{"local_access_restriction_type":[]},"publish":true},{"type":"userestrict","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"Single photocopies may be made for research purposes.

Garrison (1864-1932) was a lawyer who served as Secretary of War for President Woodrow Wilson from 1913 to 1916. As Secretary of War, Garrison was a key figure in developing policies to strengthen the nation’s military, and was also involved in issues related to the Philippines and Mexico.\n\n Lindley Miller Garrison was born on November 28, 1864 in Camden, New Jersey, the son of the Reverend Joseph Fithian Garrison and Elizabeth Van Arsdale (Grant) Garrison. His brother, Charles Grant Garrison, was a justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court. Garrison attended the Protestant Episcopal Academy and Phillips Exeter Academy, both in Philadelphia, and then studied at Harvard University for a year as a special student. In preparation for a legal career, Garrison entered the service of the law firm Redding, Jones &amp; Carson in Philadelphia in 1883. While still at the firm, he became a student at the University of Pennsylvania, where he received his Bachelor of Laws degree in 1886. He was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar that same year. Garrison married Margaret Hildeburn of Philadelphia on June 30, 1900. She died in December of 1926; they had no children.\n\n Garrison continued working at Redding, Jones &amp; Carson and its successor Jones &amp; Carson until January 1888. He was admitted to the New Jersey Bar in June 1888 and began practicing law, without partners, in Camden, New Jersey. Garrison remained in Camden until January 1899, when he founded the firm of Garrison, McManus &amp; Enright in Jersey City, New Jersey, and soon became recognized as a leader of the New Jersey Bar. He left the firm in June 1904 when he was appointed Vice Chancellor of the State, a position that corresponded to that of a supreme court justice, for a seven year term. He was the youngest Vice Chancellor ever to hold the position in New Jersey. When the term expired, he was re-appointed to serve a second term which would end in 1918.\n\n In 1913, Garrison resigned his post as Vice Chancellor to serve as Secretary of War in the Cabinet of President Woodrow Wilson. He assumed the office on March 5, 1913, the day after Wilson's inauguration. He had never served in the military, but his experience as Vice Chancellor prepared him for settling issues regarding United States dependencies, including the Philippine Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Panama Canal Zone, which the Secretary of War controlled. He also had experience involving waterway problems, another aspect of the War Department.\n\n As Secretary of War, Garrison’s main task was strengthening the nation’s defense at a time when the world was at war. Garrison drafted a plan that included a regular army of 140,000 men, a national guard of 130,000 men, and a reserve (\"continental army\") of 400,000 men. The continental army would serve for six years, training for two months every year for the first three years. While leading army officials approved the plan, it was opposed by the House Military Affairs Committee, which believed the public would not support it, and instead proposed partially federalizing the National Guard to provide the army reserve. Garrison deemed this plan to be ineffectual, but Wilson would not oppose it. Faced with irreconcilable differences with Wilson on the method for increasing the nation’s military strength, as well as objecting to Wilson’s plan to set a definite time for granting independence to the Philippines, Garrison resigned on February 11, 1916. In addition to his work on developing the country’s military strength, Garrison had also started a system of military training camps for college students, been involved in writing a bill to grant practical autonomy to the Philippines, and sent a large contingent of the army to patrol the Mexican border to protect Americans during a period of Mexican civil war following the assassination of their president, Francisco I. Madero, by conservative general Victoriano Huerta.\n\n Following his resignation, Garrison returned to the practice of law, joining the New York firm of Hornblower, Miller, Potter &amp; Earle, later Hornblower, Miller &amp; Garrison. His most prominent work while with this firm was serving as receiver of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company, later reorganized into B.M.T. Garrison was appointed to the position by Federal Judge Julius M. Mayer on December 31, 1918 to restore the company to profitability.

Kirkpatrick Jr. was born in Rochester, New York, on July 15, 1916. He attended Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, Massachusetts, and graduated from Princeton University's School of Public and International Affairs in 1938. After leaving Princeton, Kirkpatrick worked on the editorial staff of U.S. News and World Report until enlisting in the Office of the Coordinator of Information, which later evolved into the Office of Strategic Services, in 1942. Based in London, Kirkpatrick served as a liaison with British, French, Norwegian, Czech, and Polish intelligence services. In 1943, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army, where he served as the intelligence briefing officer for General Omar Bradley, a post he retained until the end of the war.\n\n After a brief return to U.S. News and World Report, Kirkpatrick joined the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) when the agency was created in 1947. He served as a division chief, deputy assistant director of operations, and executive assistant to Director of Central Intelligence Walter Bedell Smith, and appeared to be well positioned for a leadership role in the organization when he contracted polio during a 1952 trip to Asia on agency business. He was left paralyzed from the waist down in 1953 and spent the rest of his career in a wheelchair.\n\n After Kirkpatrick returned from hospitalization, Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles named him inspector general of the CIA, a post he held until 1961. Richard Helms, another intelligence officer, had been appointed director of covert operations, a job that Kirkpatrick had been expected to assume. As inspector general he traveled overseas on inspection tours, despite his wheelchair, and performed liaison work with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. He also served as chairman of a joint study group examining all of the United States' foreign intelligence efforts, a group whose report resulted in the creation of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 1961.\n\n At the request of Dulles, Kirkpatrick also compiled an internal report on the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. The controversial report, which remained classified until 1998, was critical of the planning and execution of the operation and was rumored to have caused resentment among staff at the CIA, particularly Dulles. Kirkpatrick would later write that he believed the report cost him \"a fighting chance at the directorship.\"\n\n In December 1961, John McCone, the new director of the CIA, asked Kirkpatrick to chair a working group to study the organizational structure of the agency, which resulted in a major reorganization. In April 1962, Kirkpatrick was named executive director of the CIA, a new position created in order to help ease the administrative demands on McCone and future directors.\n\n In 1965, Kirkpatrick left the CIA to become a professor of political science at Brown University. In addition to lecturing and teaching, he served as president of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers, and was a member of the board of directors of the Naval War College and the Defense Intelligence College. Kirkpatrick also contributed to Encyclopedia Britannica (as well as other encyclopedias) and wrote three books for the general public, as well as textbooks used in the intelligence community and articles for journals dealing with military and intelligence matters. He retired from Brown in 1982 and moved to Middleburg, Virginia, one year later.\n\n Kirkpatrick died at his home on March 3, 1995. He was survived by his wife, Rita Kirkpatrick, two sons and two daughters from his first marriage to Jeanne Courtney, and five grandchildren.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true}],"persistent_id":"MC209_b1","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","publish":true},{"type":"scopecontent","subnotes":[{"content":"The Lyman B.

He is said to have lived through bouts of extreme poverty while his family struggled to settle in their adoptive country. After responding to President Lincoln's call for troops and fighting with the First New York Volunteer Engineers, von Briesen returned to New York City and worked for Scientific American. A highly resourceful and ambitious man, von Briesen simultaneously studied law at New York University and was admitted to the Bar in 1868. By 1874 von Briesen ran his own firm, practicing patent law primarily. Sixteen years after his immigration, Arthur von Briesen had established himself as a distinguished lawyer.\n\n As a German immigrant, von Briesen took great interest in the German-American community in New York City as well as in other areas of the United States. He was active in a number of organizations and publications meant to speak to and on the behalf of immigrated Germans. Such organizations included the Deutscher Gesellig-wissenschaftlicher Verein, Deutsches Hospital, Liederkranz, and Deutsche Gesellschaft. His interests and philanthropic energies, however, were not exclusively German. As a leading member of the Good Government Club, von Briesen carried an influential voice in municipal as well as state legislation. Von Briesen was president of the Legal Aid Society (1890), president of the Political and Citizens Union (1896), chairman of the Ellis Island Investigating Committee (1903), president of the New York Roosevelt League (1904), and a delegate to the Universal Congress of Lawyers and Jurists in St. Louis (1904). He also served on various committees and was a member of a number of charity organizations in New York City. For the services rendered to the French and German citizens of New York in connection with the Legal Aid Society, von Briesen received the Cross of the Legion of Honor from the French government in 1905, and the Order of the Crown of Prussia from Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1906.\n\n Arthur von Briesen's greatest deed and gift to New York City was indeed his dedication and impassioned involvement as President of the Legal Aid Society. As stated in the organization's constitution of 1908, its purpose was, \"to render legal aid, gratuitously if necessary, to all who appear worthy thereof, and who are unable to procure assistance elsewhere and to promote measures for their protection.\" The Society's aim was to avoid litigation through negotiation, saving the client both time and money. The Legal Aid Society was originally founded as the Der Deutsche Rechts-Schutz-Verein in 1876 by a group of German citizens concerned with the abuses and hardships of newly arrived (German) immigrants in New York. Arthur von Briesen's rise to the Society's presidency in 1889 marked the beginnings of a larger movement in legal aid around the country. In the immediate decades thereafter, branches of the Legal Aid Society appeared in other larger cities around the country.\n\n Arthur von Briesen resigned as president of the Legal Aid Society in 1916 due to his views on the World War, then in progress. Not entirely convinced that Germany was to blame for the war, von Briesen did not want his views to threaten the future of the Legal Aid Society. Although not present in this collection, von Briesen is said to have published a number of pro-German articles (or at least calls for American neutrality--references to these are made in Series 6 of this collection) in 1914, and in 1915/6 his name was associated with the pro-German activities of George Viereck. Von Briesen became active in a number of organizations engaged in relieving the hardships wrought by war in Europe--medical aid and food shipments, primarily. And as the war worsened and exchanges with his family in Germany grew dimmer and disheartening, von Briesen too became disheartened. He died shortly after the War's close, in May 1920.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","persistent_id":"MC034_b1","publish":true},{"subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The bulk of the papers are dedicated to Arthur von Briesen's general interest and work in philanthropy and politics, both within and beyond the municipal realm of New York City.

As Legal Aid Society President, von Briesen participated in all aspects of the organization--administration, finance, publicity, the activities of its six branches, and individual case work. The collection therefore holds the Legal Aid financial files, much of its case work, and extensive correspondence between von Briesen and the Society's various directors and attorneys. The rest of the collection consists of files from his own law firm as well as from the various professional, charitable, and cultural organizations in which he took part, including the National Roosevelt League (he served as president), the Merchants' Association of New York City, Germanistic Society of America (von Briesen was a charter member), and Civil War veterans organizations. Also found are papers, printed material, and correspondence regarding German-American activities before, during, and after the First World War. Nearly half of the Arthur von Briesen Papers appear in German with only a few documents translated.

Structurally, SMWF had a board of directors and staff in Liberia, while SMWF International, headquartered in New York and also governed by its own board, served as the main fundraising arm. SMWF built new markets and renovated existing markets in Liberia following the country's civil war, using funds provided by its \"Adopt-a-Market\" campaign and from partners like the United Nations Development Programme, UN Women, African Women's Development Fund (AWDF), the government of Liberia, and various non-governmental organizations. Other services SMWF and its partners provided for Liberian women included adult literacy programs, day care facilities, training in small business management and village savings and loans, and micro-credit facilities. SMWF also raised funds to train market women in Ebola prevention when an epidemic of the disease broke out in West Africa in 2014.

White served in the United States Department of the Treasury from 1934 to 1946, rising to the position of Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, and was one of the principal architects of the Bretton Woods agreements in 1944 that established the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.\n\n White was born in Boston, Massachusetts on October 29, 1892 to Jacob and Sarah Weit, immigrants to the United States from Lithuania. He followed his father into the family hardware and crockery store business after high school. White then registered at Massachusetts Agricultural College in 1911 but left after one semester and returned to selling hardware. He enlisted in the United States Army in April 1917, six days after the United States declared war on Germany, and was sent to officers' training school. He went overseas in 1918, serving in France as a Lieutenant in the 302nd Infantry, 27th division. Before leaving for Europe, White married Anne Terry, who at the time was a student at Brown University. She later became a successful author of children's books. They had two daughters, Ruth and Joan.\n\n Upon his return to the United States in 1919, White moved to New York, where he directed an American Expeditionary Force (A.E.F.) orphan asylum for two years. He then resumed his education, enrolling at Colombia University in 1922. White transferred to Stanford University three semesters later, where he studied economics. He graduated with a B.A. from Stanford University in 1924, and received his Masters in economics, also from Stanford, a year later. White then enrolled at Harvard University, where he taught and studied economics, earning his Ph.D. in 1930. He also taught at Simmons College in Boston during that time. Faced with no opportunity for advancement at Harvard, White accepted the position of associate professor of economics at Lawrence College in Appleton, Wisconsin in 1932. He was soon raised to full professor. While there, he published his only book, The French International Accounts 1880-1913, from his dissertation work at Harvard.\n\n In June 1934, White traveled to Washington, D.C. at the request of Jacob Viner, an internationally known economist then serving as an official in the Department of the Treasury. White spent the summer studying the gold standard and international trade, given his specialty in international finance. The summer's research work evolved into a career at the Department of the Treasury. White stayed in the department as Assistant Director of Research until he became Director of the Division of Monetary Research, a position that was created for him, in 1940. In 1942, he was appointed Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury, and he served as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury from 1945 to 1946.\n\n When the United States entered World War II in December 1941, Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr. placed White in charge of all international matters for the department. In this capacity, White influenced United States international economic policy throughout World War II. He was involved with establishing post-war fiscal policy and economic assistance policies to China, Japan, and Europe after the war. White was an important advisor to Morgenthau and drafted the Morgenthau Plan for post-war Germany, which called for the de-industrialization of the country in order to remove Germany's ability to wage war. The plan was ultimately rejected, but its tenets influenced other United States policies towards Germany.\n\n White was also one of the principal architects of the Bretton Woods agreement on post-war currency stability. From 1941 to 1943, he drafted his White Plan to restore international stability after the war. The competing plan was the Keynes Plan. Both plans defined an international agency that would promote cooperative competition in world commerce and insure that the international flow of capital encouraged trade rather than becoming an independent and possibly disruptive force. In the White Plan, the agency was called the International Stabilization Fund of United and Associated Nations and was created as an adjunct to the economic power of the United States. The Fund would promote the balanced growth of international trade while preserving the role of the United States dollar in international finance, centering the international monetary system on the United States dollar and its relation to gold. In the Keyes Plan, the agency was called the International Clearing Union and would function as a world central bank that would regulate the flow of credit and act as an independent, countervailing balance to America's economic power. A joint statement, a compromise between the two plans that favored White's ideas, was presented for debate and amendment at the Bretton Woods Conference, held in New Hampshire from July 1 to 22, 1944. It was the third meeting of the Allies to debate solutions for major post-war problems before the final victory. The conference included three task groups: the Stabilization Fund Committee chaired by White, the World Bank Committee chaired by Keynes, and a third committee to consider all other proposals. The conference adopted a broad program on international finance, including many of the provisions recommended by White, and resulted in the establishment of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.\n\n In 1946, White was appointed United States Executive Director on the International Monetary Fund by President Harry S. Truman. As there was no Deputy Managing Director position at the time, White also served occasionally as the Acting Managing Director and had a highly influential role during the Fund's first year. Because of his health, White was forced to resign in 1947, and he retired from public service. Soon after his retirement, White was subpoenaed, based on the testimony of Elizabeth Bentley, by a New York grand jury that was investigating Communist infiltration, but he was not indicted. Then, in the summer of 1948, he was denounced by both Elizabeth Bentley and Whittaker Chambers before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. They claimed that, although he was not a member of the Communist Party, he had given secret information and aid to a wartime Soviet spy ring and assisted Communists in obtaining positions within the United States government. Following these accusations, White requested and was granted the opportunity to testify before the Committee on August 13, 1948, where he denied all accusations of Communism and disloyalty. He died a few days later, on August 16, 1948, of a heart attack at the age of 55. In November 1953, the case was re-opened by Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr., due to the discovery of new files and the concern that then-president Harry S. Truman had known about the accusations when appointing White as Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund. During this investigation, White was ruled to be guilty of assisting the Communists.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","publish":true},{"subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true,"content":"White's papers document his service in the Department of the Treasury and include correspondence and memoranda, notes, and writings.

He attended the Philadelphia School of Pedagogy (affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania) from 1914 to 1916, then taught public school. From 1917 to 1920 he served as a volunteer in the Jewish Legion, a military unit recruited by the British army and spent 15 months in Palestine (1919-1920). After this military service, he worked for a brief period for a news agency in New York where he met the Russian-born Bertha \"Markoosha\" Mark (1890?-1977). Markoosha had been in New York since late 1916, first as a pianist touring with a group of Russian musicians; then holding various secretarial and translator jobs, sometimes working for Soviet government officials.\n\n In 1921 Markoosha went to Berlin, Germany, to work for a former Soviet employer. Louis joined her a few months later. Aiming to get journalistic experience, he started contributing to the New York Evening Post as a European correspondent. In early 1922 he moved to Moscow. Markoosha, who had been working as an interpreter to Soviet delegations at conferences in Genoa and the Hague, joined him in September. In November, they married. Shortly thereafter, Markoosha returned to Berlin, while Louis stayed in Moscow. Their son George was born in May 1923, followed by Victor one year later. Markoosha stayed in Berlin with the boys until 1927, when she started working for the new Jewish farm colonies in the Ukraine. It was not until 1928, after Markoosha and the boys moved to Moscow, that the Fischers lived under one roof, though Louis often traveled thereafter.\n\n Louis had been working for The Nation as special European correspondent since 1923, and contributing articles to foreign papers, often selling the same article more than once. To supplement his earnings, Fischer traveled to the United States every year to give lectures on the Soviet Union. While living in Moscow, he sympathized strongly with the Soviet regime. In 1926 his first book, Oil Imperialism: The International Struggle for Petroleum, was published; it described the international struggle for Russian petroleum concessions. The two-volume study The Soviets in World Affairs (1930) followed and became a standard reference in its day. Between 1931 and 1935, he published three more books on the Soviet Union. In 1936, the year of Stalin's first purge trial, Fischer went to Spain to report on the Spanish Civil War, where he was an active supporter of the Republican anti-fascist regime, and briefly joined the International Brigades.\n\n In 1938 Fischer decided not to return to the Soviet Union. However, Markoosha and the boys, still living in Moscow as Soviet citizens, were denied permission to leave the country until Eleanor Roosevelt personally intervened. Reunited in the United States in spring 1939, the family first settled in New York—although Louis chose to live by himself in a hotel. Very soon it was obvious that their marriage was over, but until the late 1950s Louis and Markoosha stayed in close touch, visited and wrote each other, often met with the children together, and commented on each other's manuscripts. They never divorced.\n\n Louis encouraged Markoosha to write, and her autobiography, My Lives in Russia, appeared in 1944. In it, she tried to explain the life of the Russian people and the early appeal of Communism to her. She wrote articles and reviews, two novels (1948 and 1956), and in 1962 Reunion in Moscow, a Russian Revisits Her Country. In 1948-1949 she returned to Germany, working in displaced persons camps for the International Rescue and Relief Committee (IRRC). In 1949, because of ill health, she declined to work as a translator at the Nuremberg trials. However, she worked again for the IRRC in 1950-1951.\n\n In 1941 Louis's Men and Politics: An Autobiography appeared, an account of the developments in Europe between the two World Wars, and his personal encounters with politicians, correspondents, and political activists. During the Second World War, Fischer continued to report on European politics, but he also became interested in the cause of Indian independence. A guest of Mohandas Gandhi in 1942, he soon authored A Week with Gandhi (1942). He traveled to India several more times and his biography The Life of Mahatma Gandhi (1950) was the basis of the film Gandhi (1982).\n\n Fischer's other major field of interest remained the Soviet Union and its foreign policy. His first new book after his family moved to the United States appeared in 1940 and dealt with the Nazi-Bolshevik Pact of 1939. In Communist and some left wing circles he was criticized for disloyalty to the Soviet Union. In June 1945 he broke publicly with The Nation, with which he had been associated for 22 years, accusing them of a ‘misleading' representation of current events, and employing double standards, especially concerning the Soviet Union. He began writing for small anti-Communist liberal magazines such as The Progressive, as a foreign correspondent and commentator on international politics, focusing on Europe and Asia, especially Communism in the Soviet Union and China; imperialism; and the problems of emerging nations. He was one of two American contributors to The God That Failed (1949), an autobiographical collection of essays written by ex-Communists and disillusioned fellow travelers. Fischer took offense when he was labeled an ex-Communist, because he had never joined a Communist Party, having only been sympathetic to the Soviet cause. In a note for a biographical entry, he referred to himself as a \"left-of-center liberal who favors drastic social reform to improve living conditions\" and an \"active anti-imperialist.\" He was also called a \"liberal internationalist,\" and his critical but utilitarian-humanitarian beliefs placed him among those liberals who have been called \"believing skeptics.\" His publications about the Soviet Union include studies of Soviet foreign relations and biographies of Stalin (1952) and Lenin (1964), the latter winning the National Book Award. (A complete list of his books can be found in the Appendix.)\n\n Fischer's life of free-lance writing, lecturing and extensive traveling settled down with his appointment as a research associate at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton in December 1958. In 1961 he became a lecturer at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School, where he taught Soviet-American relations and Soviet foreign politics, until his death on January 15, 1970."}],"persistent_id":"MC024_b1","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","publish":true},{"type":"bioghist","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"Bertha \"Markoosha\" Fischer \n\n Bertha \"Markoosha\" Fischer was a Russian-born translator, interpretor, and writer.

He was involved in a variety of relief efforts during both world wars and their immediate aftermaths, and was the first Executive Director of UNICEF.\n\n Pate was born on October 14, 1894, in Pender, Nebraska to Richard E. and Rachel Davis Pate. When he was three, his family moved to Denver, Colorado. Pate was the eldest of seven children, three of whom died during infancy. Pate entered Princeton University in 1911 and graduated with a B.S. in 1915. Pate married Jadwiga Monkowska of Poland in 1927. They divorced ten years later after she was unable to acclimate to living in the United States. Pate married Martha B. Lucas, an educator, on October 31, 1961. He had no children.\n\n Immediately after his graduation from Princeton University, Pate obtained employment at the First National Bank in Hartley, Iowa, where his uncle was president. He remained there for a short time before World War I inspired him to volunteer to work with Herbert Hoover's Commission for Relief in Belgium in 1916. Pate worked as a field representative in the county of Tournai, overseeing the distribution of food to Belgians. Pate became close friends with Herbert Hoover and collaborated with him on relief works throughout the rest of his career. After the United States declared war, Pate joined the U.S. Army. He served in France from 1917 to 1919, first with the 29th Engineers and later with the 74th Engineers. He was promoted to the rank of Master Engineer, Senior Grade, in December 1917 and obtained the rank of Second Lieutenant of Engineers in November 1918.\n\n In 1919, after his service in the Army was completed, Pate returned to work for Hoover's Commission in Poland, which was by then named the American Relief Administration. Pate, as Assistant to the Director of the American Relief Administration in Poland, coordinated efforts to provide food and other aid to 1.3 million children. In 1920, after Pate made an initial survey of conditions in Russia, the Administration began food relief operations for millions of Russians as well. Pate remained with the American Relief Administration until its operations ended in 1922.\n\n Pate remained in Poland, working as assistant to the Warsaw manager of the Polish subsidiary of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey from 1922 to 1927. Pate then operated his own import business in Poland and served as the Warsaw representative of two American banks and one English bank. He returned to the United States in 1935, working in New York as an investment banker and serving as the director of several machine-tool and natural gas firms until 1939.\n\n After Germany's invasion of Poland, Pate returned to relief work, serving as President of the Commission for Polish Relief from 1939 to 1941. The Commission, in which Herbert Hoover was very active, was a privately operated organization that coordinated the purchasing and shipment of supplies to the Polish people. Once the United States entered the war, Pate became Director of Relief to American and Allied Prisoners of War for the American Red Cross. He served in this capacity from 1942 to 1946, coordinating the shipment of $170 million of relief supplies, including food, clothing and medicine, to prisoners of war in Europe and the Far East. In 1946, Pate was selected to be part of Herbert Hoover's World Food Survey, a mission given to Hoover by President Harry S. Truman to organize the means to alleviate worldwide famine conditions. The group visited many countries, and Pate's role was to assess the relief needs of children. The work of the survey and Hoover's subsequent recommendations to Truman led to the United States sponsorship of the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF).\n\n UNICEF was established on December 11, 1946 by the United Nations General Assembly as a three year operation to provide emergency food and supplies to children in countries devastated by the war, primarily in Europe. Pate was selected as the first executive director in 1947. UNICEF provided aid to children based solely on their need, regardless of their nationality, using funds voluntarily contributed by governments, organizations, and individuals. After the three year term was completed, UNICEF was renewed for another three years to help governments in developing countries establish programs to provide basic protection from disease and malnutrition to children and their mothers, addressing the chronically poor conditions for children in those nations. In 1953, UNICEF was established as a permanent organization to continue with its work in aiding governments in establishing health, medical, and educational programs for their nations' children. They also continue to provide emergency aid supplies during crises. At this time, the name was shortened to the United Nations Children's Fund, although the acronym UNICEF was retained. It has become one of the most internationally recognized, and least controversial, of the United Nations' programs.\n\n Pate oversaw the growth and changing mission of UNICEF, remaining its executive director until his death in 1965. He visited nearly all of the 133 countries where UNICEF operated during his tenure as executive director, assessing the needs of children and the existing programs, negotiating with governments, and fundraising. While he was executive director, the number of governments contributing funds to UNICEF grew from 35 in 1951 to 118 in 1965.\n\n Pate received decorations throughout his life for his humanitarian aid work, including awards from the governments of Belgium, Ecuador, France, the Netherlands, and Poland. He received an honorary degree from Denison University in 1956 and Princeton University in 1958. Pate was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize but declined to be considered, insisting that it was the organization of UNICEF, not any one individual, that improved the welfare of the world's children. Pate died on January 19, 1965, at the age of 70. UNICEF was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in October 1965.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"MC103_b1","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"d350add484d2ac98fc9655856ed951bb","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","type":"scopecontent","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"Pate's papers document his career as a humanitarian and include correspondence, reports, Pate's notes and writings, publications, and photographs, as well as biographical materials and Pate's personal correspondence.

Born in Spokane, Washington, Bird enlisted in the Navy at age 18 in 1943. After serving in the Navy for two years following World War II, Bird studied journalism at the University of Oregon in Eugene. His first positions were with the United Press and a small local newspaper. Eugene Bird's wife, Jerine \"Jerri\" Bird (1926-2012), traveled with her husband on his Foreign Service assignments. She was born in Portland but primarily grew up in Eugene, Oregon.\n\n Eugene and Jerine Bird were married in 1948, a few months after Jerine graduated from the University of Oregon. They traveled to Stockholm in the fall of 1950 so both could attend the University of Sweden. Upon their return from Stockholm, Eugene enrolled in graduate school in the United States, specializing in the economic history of Europe. \n\n In 1952, Eugene Bird became an intern in the U.S. State Department, where he first worked in the public affairs and personnel offices. He was transferred to the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs in 1953. Bird entered the Foreign Service in 1955 and was assigned to the political desk covering Israel and Jordan. \n\n Eugene Bird received his first international position in May 1956, serving as a vice-consul in the American Consulate General in Jerusalem. Though Jerine and their children left at the outbreak of the Suez Crisis, Eugene remained in Jerusalem until June 1958. From 1958-1961, Eugene Bird was assigned to the Foreign Service Institute, and spent much of his time there studying Arabic. His language studies continued with his next assignment in Beirut, Lebanon, where he studied at the Lebanese University. \n\n From 1962-1965, Eugene Bird was assigned to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, serving as the economic officer for the Consulate General. In 1965, he was transferred to Cairo, Egypt, where he continued to work in economics as the commercial attaché. He and his family were evacuated from Cairo at the outbreak of the Six-Day War in 1967.\n\n Eugene and Jerine Bird spent the remainder of 1967-1972 in India. Eugene was first the economic officer in Bombay, and later served as the commercial attaché in New Delhi. They returned to Saudi Arabia in 1972, where Eugene was the political and economic counselor in Jeddah until his retirement in 1975.\n\n Eugene Bird was president of the Council for the National Interest (CNI) for 17 years after his retirement from the Foreign Service. The Council for the National Interest, along with its associated organization, the Council for the National Interest Foundation (CNIF), provides information and analysis on the Middle East and its relationship to the United States while promoting U.S. foreign policies that protect national interests.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"persistent_id":"MC281_b1","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","type":"bioghist","subnotes":[{"content":"Biography of Jerrine \"Jerri\" Bird \n\n Jerine \"Jerri\" Bird (1926-2012) was born in Portland but primarily grew up in Eugene, Oregon.

The group promoted the settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and advocated for human rights in both Israel and Palestine. Partners for Peace was known for its U.S. speaking tours featuring Israeli and Palestinian women. The organization disbanded in 2011.\n\n Jerine Bird was also an administrator at Harvard University's Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington, D.C. from 1989-1996. She authored a book chapter, titled \"Revolution for Children in Saudi Arabia,\" that was published in Children in the Muslim Middle East (University of Texas Press, 1995).

Eisenhower campaigns, and as Special Assistant on International Trade for President John F. Kennedy. Petersen was also a principal drafter of the Selective Service Act, a lawyer, and president of Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company.\n\n Howard Charles Petersen was born in East Chicago, Indiana on May 7, 1910. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1930 from DePauw University and a law degree (J.D.) with distinction in 1933 from the University of Michigan. He also received honorary degrees from DePauw University in 1953, Drexel Institute at St. Joseph's College in 1962, Swarthmore College in 1968, and the University of Pennsylvania in 1974. Petersen married Elizabeth Anna Watts of Princeton, Indiana in 1936, whom he met while he was a student at DePauw University. They had two children, Elizabeth Spiro Clark and Howard Jr.\n\n From 1933 to 1941, Petersen was an associate in the New York law firm Cravath, deGersdorff, Swaine &amp; Wood. He worked predominantly on general corporation, financial, and public utility law, specializing in utility bond issues. He was also involved with the first security filings done by the firm under the new Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations. While at the law firm, Petersen was introduced to Grenville Clark. Clark enlisted Petersen to leave the practice of law and become a member of the National Emergency Committee of the Military Training Camps Association. The Military Training Camps Association was formed during World War I by Clark and Elihu Root to train officers for the United States Military. The National Emergency Committee of the association was formed in 1941 with Grenville Clark as chair. As a key member of the committee, Petersen was one of the principal drafters of the Burke-Wadsworth Bill, which became the Selective Service Act of 1940. He then served as counsel of the committee appointed by President Roosevelt to draft the initial regulations for the Selective Service.\n\n Petersen was hired as the special assistant and then executive assistant to the Undersecretary of War, Robert P. Patterson, from 1941 to 1945. He was promoted to Special Assistant to the Secretary of War, also under Robert P. Patterson, in 1945. In December 1945, Petersen was appointed Assistant Secretary of War by President Truman, a position he held until August 1947. His worked on the economic recovery of occupied Germany and the Western Allies and supervised United States military occupational activities in Germany, Japan, Korea, Austria, and Italy, traveling overseas several times to carry out his duties. One of his significant contributions was to help prevent famine in Europe by laying the groundwork for the Marshall Plan. He also served as the War Department’s chief representative at the State Department on political policy and the War Department's member on the State-War-Navy Coordination Committee. Petersen was awarded the Medal of Merit, Exceptional Civilian Service Award, and the Selective Service Medal for his service. He resigned his post for financial reasons.\n\n Petersen returned to private sector work as Executive Vice President and Director of Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company, later renamed The Fidelity Bank. He was elected President and Chief Executive Officer in 1950. Through his leadership, Petersen transformed a mid-sized Philadelphia trust company into a modern full-service bank within the national and international financial communities. He was also involved in the banking industry as a whole, serving as president of the Pennsylvania Bankers Association and filling key roles in the American Bankers Association and the International Monetary Conference.\n\n He retained his position at Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company while also serving Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy. From 1951 to 1953, Petersen served as the National Finance Chairman for the 1952 Eisenhower presidential campaign and as Chairman of the Finance Committee for the Citizens for Eisenhower. In 1954, he was a member of the Finance Committee of the National Citizens for Eisenhower Congressional Committee, and he assisted in fundraising for the Eisenhower campaign in 1956, but not in an official capacity. Petersen served as Special Assistant to President John F. Kennedy for International Trade Policy from 1961 to 1962. He was appointed to manage Kennedy's controversial campaign for a new foreign trade policy. His main task was to assist with the passage of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, and he also negotiated the conclusion of the 1960-1962 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations with the European Economic Community. Petersen resigned after the Trade Expansion Act was passed.\n\n He was elected Chairman of Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company in 1966. In 1969, he became the Chairman and CEO of Fidelity Corporation of Pennsylvania, later renamed Fidelcor Inc. He retired as CEO of Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company and Fidelity Corporation in 1975 but continued as Chairman of both institutions. He resumed his responsibilities as President and CEO on an interim basis in 1978, and retired December 31, 1978.\n\n In addition, Petersen served as a member, director, or chairman of a wide variety of institutions, including financial, political, legal, education, and social organizations. These positions included chairman of the Adela Investment Company, a corporation for the development of Latin America, an officer for the Committee for Economic Development, Director of the Panama Canal Corporation, and a trustee of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Petersen was chairman of the boards of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., the University of Pennsylvania Museum, and the Marshall Foundation, and chairman and advisory committee member of Export-Import Bank of Washington.\n\n Howard Petersen died in 1995 at his home in Radnor, Pennsylvania, at the age of 85."}],"type":"bioghist","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","persistent_id":"dbba16cd411ab5cdad0a4176a0af3d62","subnotes":[{"content":"Petersen's papers document his entire career, especially his work with the new Security and Exchange Commission regulations as a lawyer in the 1930s and with the United States War Department during World War II, and include correspondence, articles, and publications.

The dual occurrence of an increased need for synthetic rubber during the war and the threat of being cut off from present suppliers sent the United States in search of new and more stable sources of rubber. No longer could the United States completely depend on foreign countries to provide rubber. For instance, the Asian supply was suffering from a leaf blight which drove up prices and the Japanese supply was limited due to political tensions. Consequently, the formation of the Rubber Development Corporation (RDC) attempted to meet this need, but without much success.\n\n The RDC evolved out of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) which had three functions. First, low interest loans were given to banks, businesses and industries in an attempt to stabilize a faltering economy. Second, the RFC financed the newly formed Rubber Reserve Company (RRC) which bought rubber from Southeast Asia and tried to develop synthetic rubber in the United States. Third, the RFC supported the Rubber Development Corporation (RDC) which wanted to maximize rubber production from Brazil.\n\n Eventually, the RDC was divided into three sections under the supervision of its president, Douglas H. Allen. The Banco de Credito da Borracha financed production costs and purchased the products of the RDC. The SEMTA division dealt with labor acquisition and transportation to the Amazon. Once in the Brazil area, the SAVA ( Services de Abasteciment do Vale Amazonico) division distributed the labor in order to maintain balanced and well-equipped posts.\n\n The United States held two common interests in Brazil. An experimental nursery was set up in Brazil on the grounds of the Agronomic Institute of the North (IAN) under the supervision of Dr. Felisberto Cardoso de Camargo. This was an attempt to gain extensive knowledge about synthetic rubber production. Also, the Hevea trees in the Amazon Valley attracted the interest of the United States which eventually led to a rubber agreement on March 3, 1942 between Brazil and the United States. The initial rubber agreement guaranteed that the United States would buy all excess rubber at forty-five cents a pound until December 31, 1946. This allowed Brazil to produce rubber at an unlimited rate without the threat of monetary loss. Ten months later in December, the agreement was modified to increase Brazil's exportation to 50,000 tons of rubber in 1943.\n\n The presence of the RDC is still felt in Brazil. Many families mourn for the seventeen to twenty thousand tappers who never returned from the forest because primitive and dangerous conditions such as the ever present threat of illness and Indian attacks were not favorable to the workers. However, many braved these conditions because the RDC was paying top dollar to ensure high production and favorable results. Before the RDC arrived in Brazil, tappers or seringueiros were managed by seringalistas in small groves. Today, the majority of tappers who did survive the forest are not receiving pensions due to lost paper work.\n\n As shown above, time, effort, and money were seriously invested into this project, but a lack of efficiency eventually lead to the failure of RDC, Amazon Division. At one point, RDC purchased a crop of Brazilian nuts in the hopes that it would incite Brazilian workers to produce more rubber as well as satisfy eager American buyers. While the connection between nuts and rubber production is blurry, the purchase would definitely meet the American demand for nuts. For one million dollars, the nuts were purchased. However, transportation of the nuts to America was not provided for. The nuts spoiled and the RDC suffered a net loss of $800,000. The only sign of a slight improvement was in 1946 when production increased, but the quality of the rubber remained pathetically poor.

Myers was born in Baltimore on June 17, 1877. He graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1897 and received his PhD in Philosophy from Johns Hopkins in 1900. Myers’ first job after graduation was as Master in History at the Gilman School in Baltimore. In 1906, Woodrow Wilson summoned Myers to Princeton to become a preceptor in history at Princeton University. Myers became a Professor of History and Politics in 1918 and served in that position until he became Professor Emeritus in June 1943.\n\n Myers was a respected historian who published numerous noteworthy books during his career. He often wrote on the subject of contemporary history. Myers became an authority on the history of the Republican Party in the early twentieth century by publishing books such as The Republican Party: A History (1928) and The Hoover Administration (1936). Always active in Republican Party affairs both local and national, Myers eventually became friends with Herbert Hoover and edited a collection of Hoover’s papers and writings. Myers was also a noted New Jersey historian, publishing a history of the state and a history of the Battle of Monmouth. He was instrumental in the campaign to gain National Historic Landmark status for the Princeton Battlefield. Myers was quite active professionally. He served as a lecturer at the Army War College in Washington, D.C. from 1920 to 1940, published regularly in historical journals, and attended and spoke at numerous roundtable conferences. Away from the history profession, Myers was a practicing Episcopalian, serving as president of the board of managers of the Evangelical Education Society for nearly a decade. Myers was also a Trustee of the Lake Placid Club Education Foundation from 1929 to 1931 and a member of the Small Loans Commission of New Jersey from 1931 to 1932.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"persistent_id":"MC098_b1","publish":true},{"subnotes":[{"content":"The William Starr Myers Papers document his teaching career and published works, and include diaries, drafts, notes, lectures, correspondence, printed material, photographs, and scrapbooks.

She served as advisor to the Kenya and East African Women's Seminars, Regional Advisor of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, Vice President of the Sirleaf Market Women's Fund, co-founded the African Training and Research Center for Women, and was the Founding Director of the United Nations Development Fund for Women.\n\n Margaret Snyder, known as Peg to family and friends, was born in 1929 in Syracuse, New York. In 1950 she received a Bachelor of Arts in Social Science from the College of New Rochelle and in 1952 earned a Master of Arts degree in Sociology from The Catholic University of America. In 1953 at the age of 24, Snyder became the youngest Dean of Women in the United States. She served as dean at LeMoyne College for eight years. In 1961, she took a one year sabbatical to travel to Africa, where she worked with the Women's Africa Committee. Snyder's initial desire was to make a contribution to educational needs, promote an international student program, and stimulate her students' interest in international affairs. Due to the limited opportunities for African girls at the time, she soon began working to develop the Kenya African Women's Association, serving as an advisor and helping with preparations for the recently founded group. Their goal was \"to raise the standard of Kenya women and girls through educational, social and cultural common interests.\"\n\n At the end of Snyder's first year in Kenya, she chose to relinquish her deanship at LeMoyne and remained in Africa through 1964. As an adviser on organization and educational projects for the Women's African Commission in Tanganyika, she continued to work with groups in Kenya and Tanganyika, and was a member of the first Kenya and East African Women's Seminars. From 1965-1970 she was the Assistant Director, Programme of Eastern African Studies, the Maxwell School, Syracuse University and consultant to the State University of New York.\n\n After earning a Ph.D. in Sociology from the University of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania in 1971, Dr. Snyder accepted her first position with the United Nations as Consultant for the Economic Commission for Africa Regional Programme on Advancement of Women, which she held from 1971-1978. In this position, Snyder went on several missions throughout Africa to assess conditions of women in different countries. During this period she also co-founded the African Training and Research Centre for Women (ATRCW), which laid the foundation for women's programs ( including content, research) and training, across the world.\n\n In 1978 Dr. Snyder broadened her work and became the Founding Director of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), formerly known as the Voluntary Fund for the United Nations Decade for Women. This organization worked not just with women in Africa, but Asia, the Pacific, Latin America, and the Caribbean, creating new programs to help increase the status and education of rural women throughout the world. UNIFEM also worked with other organizations such as Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA), Women's World Banking, and the Centre for Social Development and Humanitarian Affairs (CSDHA).\n\n From 1992-1993, Dr. Snyder was a Visiting Fellow at the Centre of International Studies, the Woodrow Wilson School, at Princeton University. She was granted a Fulbright Scholar award for the 1994-1995 academic year to go to Uganda.\n\n Dr. Synder was part of the group of individuals who organized, edited, and distributed Liberian Women Peacemakers (Africa World Press, 2004) under the name the African Women and Peace Support Group. This same group of individuals later formed the Sirleaf Market Women's Fund (SMWF), a nonprofit fund for the economic development and empowerment of Liberian women. Dr. Snyder is currently Vice President Emeritus of SMWF.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","type":"bioghist","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"6128d4db1e9606f4085c6680de18e768","subnotes":[{"content":"The Margaret Snyder Papers document her involvement with organizations working with African women, including the Kenya and East African Women's Seminars, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, the African Training and Research Center for Women, the United Nations Development Fund for Women, and the Sirleaf Market Women's Fund.

He served in the League of Nations from 1934 to 1945 and taught at Columbia University from 1945 to 1958.\n\n Ragnar Nurkse was born October 5, 1907 in Tallinn, Estonia. His family immigrated to Canada in the early 1930s. He married Harriet Berger of Englewood, New Jersey in 1946 and they had two sons, Dennis and Peter. Nurkse received his education at the University of Tartu, Estonia, from 1926 to 1928 and then the University of Edinburgh. He graduated from Edinburgh with a first class degree in Economics, under Professor F.W. Ogilvie, in 1932. He also earned a Carnegie Fellowship to study at the University of Vienna from 1932 to 1934. While in Vienna, he published his first economics article, entitled \"Cause and Effects of Capital Movements,\" in German. His first book, which was on the same subject and also in German, was published in 1935.\n\n He served in the Financial Section and Economic Intelligence Service of the League of Nations from 1934 to 1945. Nurkse was the financial analyst and was largely responsible for the annual Monetary Review. He was also involved with the publication of The Review of World Trade, World Economic Surveys, and the report of the Delegation on Economic Depressions entitled \"The Transition from War to Peace Economy.\" League of Nations reports are typically published anonymously, but Nurkse is the author of The International Currency Experience, 1944 (except for Chapter VI), a classic in the field of international finance, and also wrote the first analytical section of The Course and Control of Inflation, 1946.\n\n In 1945, Nurkse was offered a position in the International Monetary Fund, but he chose instead to accept an appointment at Columbia University in New York City. He was a Visiting Lecturer in Economics at Columbia University from 1945 to 1946, taught at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, from 1946 to 1947, and then returned to Columbia as an Associate Professor of Economics in 1947. In 1949, he was promoted to Full Professor of Economics, a position which he held until his death in 1959. He taught international economics, economic development, and money and banking.\n\n Nurkse was an important figure in economic development theory as an early advocate of the \"balanced growth\" doctrine. He also continued to build on the Rostenstein-Rodan Theory of the Big Push and anticipated portions of the Lewis doctrine, emphasizing the role of savings and capital formation in economic development. Among his major works are International Currency Experience: Lessons of the Interwar Period (1944), Conditions of International Monetary Equilibrium (1945), and Problems of Capital Formation in Underdeveloped Countries (1953).\n\n He spent a sabbatical at Nuffield College, Oxford from 1954 to 1955, and from 1958 to 1959 he studied economic development in Geneva and lectured around the world. The majority of his later writings, on problems of economic development and international trade, were derived from lectures given at Cairo, Istanbul, Rio de Janeiro, Singapore, and Stockholm, as well as his Columbia lecture courses.\n\n In 1958, Ragnar Nurkse was offered a Professorship of Economics and the Director of International Finance Section position at Princeton University. He accepted, seeking to work in a smaller city. However, when Nurkse returned to Geneva in the spring of 1959, after delivering the Wicksell Memorial Lectures in Stockholm, he died suddenly at the age of 52. At the time of his death, he was working on a comprehensive book on trade and development.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"MC173_b1","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true,"content":"Nurse's papers document his scholarly work at both the League of Nations and Columbia, and includes his research notes, drafts of articles and books, research materials and a small amount of correspondence.

He received a Bachelor of Science Degree from Springfield College in 1933. After graduation, he taught at the Wilbraham Academy until 1938. He continued his education and received a Master's Degree in Economics in 1939 from Clark University. Wilson then went on to teach for one year at the Staten Island Academy before moving on to the Putney School. He taught at Putney for two years before serving as a Lieutenant in the United States Navy during World War II. After the war, he enrolled in the doctoral program at the University of Wisconsin where he received his Ph.D. in political science in 1947.\n\n Wilson joined the Princeton faculty in 1947 as a specialist on American institutions and the British government. His Politics 203 (Political Power in the U.S.) and 306 (Politics of Civil Liberties) courses became favorites of undergraduates. Wilson developed the Politics 203 course to shock and stimulate students to be aware of the problems of power and dissent in American political life. This groundbreaking approach of studying political phenomena through an analysis of the class, group and power structures of a given society was quickly copied by other institutions. Wilson also taught two graduate courses, Politics 508 (American Legislatures) and 524 (Political Power in American Society).\n\n An ardent supporter of civil liberties, Wilson was highly critical of Senator Joseph McCarthy, the United States Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I.) director J. Edgar Hoover. He organized a conference of legal authorities and educators to criticize Hoover's leadership of the F.B.I., and he helped to form the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee when the American Civil Liberties Union refused to defend self-professed Communists. He was also a member of the National Advisory Committee of Consumers Union, and served on the Advisory Committee of the L.M. Rabinowitz Foundation. In 1966, he participated in the Yale Socialist Symposium and in 1967 took part in the Philadelphia Peace Convention.\n\n Wilson retired in May 1977 and was named Professor Emeritus in July of 1977. In August 1977, Wilson was found dead in a small swimming pool at his home. Wilson escaped to the pool in an attempt to avoid a swarm of bees (to which he was allergic) that he stirred up while mowing his lawn. The official cause of death was drowning associated with anaphylactic reaction due to bee stings.","publish":true}],"type":"bioghist","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"content":"The H.H.

He was born in Shanghai on February 24, 1906, where his father served as General Secretary of the Young Men's Christian Association. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from DePauw University in 1927, received his doctorate from Harvard and went on to teach at Bowdoin College from 1929 to 1930. In the late 1930s, he was a lecturer in economics at the University of Michigan's summer sessions.\n\n From 1935 until 1940, Lockwood was the Research Secretary of the American Council of the Institute of Pacific Relations, and between 1941 and 1943 he served as Executive Secretary. The Institute of Pacific Relations (IPR) was founded in Honolulu in 1925 at a conference of religious leaders, scholars and businessmen from various countries of the Pacific area. The organization grew out of the need for greater knowledge and candid discussion of the problems of Asia and East-West relations. The IPR consisted of national councils in ten countries, with each council being autonomous and responsible for its own work. Together the councils cooperated in programs of research, publication and conferences. The IPR's research program received generous support from the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation, enabling the institute to disseminate information about Asia in the United States and in other countries.\n\n Lockwood was involved in a number of government investigations during his tenure with the IPR. From 1937 until 1943 he served on the editorial board of Amerasia, a foreign relations magazine that grew out of the initial IPR conference. Although not an official IPR publication, Amerasia shared office space with the IPR, and many of its editors and contributors were IPR members. In 1945, six people, including Philip Jaffe, Amerasia's editor at the time, were arrested on charges of theft of government documents. Lockwood was questioned about his role at Amerasia, although he had resigned from the board when the magazine changed its focus from foreign relations to what Lockwood called a \"different\" slant. In 1951, Senator Joseph McCarthy resurrected the case when Senator Pat McCarran seized IPR files stored in a barn in Massachusetts. Included in the files was a letter Lockwood wrote in 1942, while Executive Secretary of the IPR. In the letter, Lockwood stated that Alger Hiss, an IPR board member, recommended Adlai Stevenson as a delegate to the IPR's Mont Tremblant Conference. McCarthy claimed that this letter implicated Stevenson with Hiss. In March of 1952, William Lockwood testified before McCarran's Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Internal Security in defense of the IPR.\n\n As a result of the Senate charges that the IPR was a Communist front organization attempting to influence government policy, tax commissioner T. Coleman Andrews revoked the IPR's tax-exempt status in 1955. The IPR took the case to court in 1959, claiming that the security of all educational, religious and charitable organizations needed to be maintained, and in 1960 the court ruled in its favor and reinstated the tax-exempt status. Throughout the investigations, the IPR maintained that its purpose was to serve as an educational organization, engaged in scholarship and publishing in regard to the Far East, and in no way was it attempting to influence government policy. Although the IPR admitted that certain members of the organization may have been Communists, the organization itself did not condone Communism. Although vindicated in the tax case, the IPR was scarred by McCarthy's and McCarran's relentless accusations and investigations. As a result, its membership dwindled and its contributors and sponsors fled.\n\n From 1943 until 1945, Lockwood served as an officer with the U.S. Army. He was in charge of research and analysis for the Office of Strategic Services unit attached to General Claire L. Chennault's 14th Air Force in Kunming, China, and eventually achieved the rank of major. After World War II, Lockwood spent a year in Washington with the State Department as the assistant chief of the Division of Japanese and Korean Economic Affairs. In 1946 he came to Princeton as the assistant director of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. Promoted to Associate Professor in 1949 and full Professor in 1955, Lockwood focused on the political and economic development of Asia. Lockwood's courses included \"Modern Asia: Political and Social Change\" and a graduate seminar on \"Political Development and U.S. Foreign Aid in Asia.\" He retired in 1971 after 25 years as a member of the Princeton faculty.\n\n William Lockwood was a frequent contributor to scholarly journals, and author of a number of studies and reports on economic and political developments in the Far East. For ten years he was the Director of the Japan Society, and was also the Director of the Association for Asian Studies, serving as President during 1963-64. In the 1960s he served briefly as Chairman of the Editorial Board of the Princeton University Press and was Vice-President of Princeton-in-Asia, Inc. In 1953 he toured Asia as a consultant for the Ford Foundation and again in 1956-57 and 1962 on Ford and Fulbright research appointments. Named a McCosh Faculty Fellow in 1965, he returned to Japan once more to continue his studies of Asian politics and economic development. At the time of his death in December,1978, he was at work on a book about the development of democracy in Asia.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","publish":true},{"type":"scopecontent","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"content":"The bulk of the William W.

He also served as a United States government official working on the formation and implementation of foreign economic policies during World War II and the 1960s.\n\n Henry Richardson Labouisse was born in New Orleans, Louisiana on February 11, 1904. He was one of two sons of Henry Richardson Labouisse and Frances Devereaux (Huger) Labouisse. He married Elizabeth Scriven Clark on June 29, 1935 and they had one daughter, Anne (Farnsworth). Elizabeth Labouisse died in 1945. Labouisse remarried on November 19, 1954, to Eve Curie, daughter of the scientists Pierre and Marie Curie. Curie was a renowned author and journalist. They met in 1951, while he was on the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) staff and she was a secretary with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\n\n Labouisse earned his B.A. from Princeton University in 1926 and graduated from Harvard University Law School in 1929. He was admitted into the New York State bar the following year. Labouisse was an associate and member of the New York City law firm Taylor, Blanc, Capron and Marsh, and its successor firm Mitchell, Taylor, Capron &amp; Marsh, from 1929 to 1941.\n\n When the United States entered the Second World War, Labouisse chose to serve his country by accepting a position in the State Department. He began there in 1941 and rose through a variety of positions over the next several years, most concerned with forming and implementing foreign economic policy. His first position was as assistant chief of the Division of Defense Materials in December 1941. He was promoted to chief of the division in February 1943. Later in 1943, he was made deputy director of the Office of Foreign Economic Coordination, and in January 1944 he was appointed chief of the Eastern Hemisphere Division. In March 1944, he was transferred to the Office of European Affairs, where he was special assistant to the director.\n\n Labouisse was appointed chief of the Foreign Economic Administration mission to France in November 1944 and served concurrently as minister for economic affairs at the American Embassy. He became special assistant to Under Secretary of State, William L. Clayton, in November 1945. Through his work with the undersecretary, and his previous work coordinating aid to various European reconstruction points, Labouisse played an important role in the aid efforts that culminated in the Marshall Plan. In July 1946, he returned to his role as special assistant to the director of the Office of European Affairs.\n\n Labouisse then served as the principal State Department officer working with the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) during the initial implementation of the Marshall Plan. He traveled to Paris in March 1948 as head of the mission to establish the ECA as the agency to administer United States economic aid to Europe. He returned to Europe in May 1948 as the head of the United States delegation to the Geneva meeting of the Economic Commission for Europe. Labouisse then served as coordinator of foreign aid and assistance in the State Department from June 1948 until October 1949, when he became director of British Commonwealth and Northern European Affairs. He held this post until September 1951. He began arguing for a tougher stance on aid in 1949, one that would force European economies to adjust to market forces. In September 1951, Labouisse was named head of the ECA's mission to France, journeying to Paris as head of the Marshall Plan mission. When the ECA was replaced by the Mutual Security Administration and the Foreign Operations Administration, Labouisse headed the Paris missions of both agencies from 1951 to June 1954.\n\n Labouisse left United States government service in 1954 to work for the United Nations. He was appointed director of the United Nations Relief and Work Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) in June 1954 at the request of United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld. The UNRWA was established in December 1949 to carry out relief and works projects in cooperation with local governments. When Labouisse assumed his directorship, the UNRWA was responsible for the care of 887,000 Arab refugees who had fled Palestine in 1948. Labouisse oversaw the improvement of the standard of living in the refugee camps, raised the standards of health, education, and vocational training, and established a grant program that allowed refugees to make a down payment on a farm or shop. He left the UNRWA in 1958.\n\n Labouisse was appointed as a consultant to the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development in May 1959. He headed a survey mission to Venezuela in September 1959 to assist in the formulation of a program of economic development. He was recalled from that mission by Hammarskjöld to serve as special advisor to the secretary-general during the Congo crisis in 1960. In December 1960, Labouisse was appointed as the International Bank's special representative for Africa and also headed a mission to Uganda to study economic problems.\n\n He returned to United States government service in January 1961, when he was appointed Director of the International Cooperation Administration (ICA) by President John F. Kennedy, which was created to coordinate nonmilitary foreign aid programs. Labouisse had been considered for the post by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in February 1959, but his appointment was rejected by Republican national chairman Meade Alcorn on the grounds that Labouisse had registered as a Democrat several years earlier. In May 1961, President Kennedy began to work with Congress to reorganize the foreign aid programs into a single agency. The ICA was eliminated during the reorganization, and Labouisse was named United States Ambassador to Greece. He held that post from 1962 to 1965.\n\n Labouisse was appointed the second Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in June 1965, following the death of the first director, Maurice Pate. During his directorship, Labouisse oversaw the emergency relief efforts for several major conflicts and naturals disasters, and fought to alleviate poor conditions in developing countries. UNICEF provided relief to both sides in the Nigerian civil war in 1968 and to Cambodia in 1979, after the country was invaded by Vietnam.\n\n Labouisse retired from his position with UNICEF in December 1979, although he continued to work as a consultant on the Cambodia and Thailand operations for most of 1980. After his retirement, Labouisse continued to be active in various organizations, including serving as Chairman of the Board of the American Farm School in Thessaloniki Greece from 1980 to 1985 and as trustee of the school from 1965 to 1985.

The organization's mission is to provide secondary education to girls from rural Indian communities, thereby creating viable socio-economic alternatives to child marriage and enabling women to make independent life choices.\n\n Jacqueline de Chollet, a Swiss woman, founded the Veerni Project in 1993, with an initial objective of providing family planning, medical, and nutritional education programs for women living in rural villages in the Thar Desert. After building relationships with village communities throughout the 1990s, the Veerni Project piloted a tutor-based program for girls in 2000, shifting the organization's focus towards women's secondary education. In 2004, Veerni adopted a new educational model; rather than bringing tutors into villages, the project began funding village girls' attendance at private secondary schools in the city of Jodhpur and providing lodging in a nearby boarding hostel.\n\n Since 2005, under the direction of Mahendra Sharma, the Veerni Institute has operated a boarding hostel in Jodhpur where 75-90 girls live at a time. In addition to attending classes, girls participate in academic tutoring, career counseling, health camps, and self defense training, as well as art, sewing, language, and computer classes, and are encouraged to consider pursuing a college education after graduation. A significant portion of Veerni's students at any time are already child brides. In exchange for the free lodging and tuition Veerni provides, their parents must sign a pledge promising to delay sending girls to their husbands until they have at least completed secondary school. Since 2012, Veerni has also run an after-school literacy program in Meghwalon ki Dhanki, a village where girls were struggling to pass entrance exams for the Veerni Institute. The Veerni Institute receives applications from more girls than it can accept each year, leading the organization to found a second boarding hostel in Jodhpur, called Veerni Balika, which opened in July 2019.\n\n The Veerni Project is funded by family foundations and individuals in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States, including the Global Foundation for Humanity, Fondation Veerni, and the Association du Projet Veerni. Director Mahendra Sharma has led Veerni since 2005, and the organization has an all-Indian board and staff.","publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","type":"scopecontent","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true,"content":"Consists of records of the Veerni Project, a non-governmental organization based in Rajasthan, India, which provides secondary education and boarding hostels for girls from rural villages in the Thar Desert to attend school in Jodhpur.

Lutz also served as an advisor on public finance, especially taxation, to the federal and state governments and was an outspoken opponent of increases in government spending.\n\n Harley Leist Lutz was born in Ross County, Ohio on July 30, 1882 to Ira and Minnie (Leist) Lutz. He earned his A.B. from Oberlin College in 1907 and then studied economics at Harvard University, earning his A.M. in 1908 and his Ph.D. in 1914. Lutz married Rachel A. Young on December 31, 1909 and they had three children: Robert G. Lutz, Martha J. (Page), and Barbara (Rinehart).\n\n Lutz was a professor of economics at Oberlin College from 1909 to 1923 and was also head of their Economics Department from 1914 to 1923. He then moved to Stanford University, where he was a professor of economics from 1923 until 1928, when Professor Edwin W. Kemmerer persuaded him to join the faculty at Princeton University. At Princeton, Lutz taught undergraduate and graduate courses in public finance, and he was also a frequent author and speaker on the subject. His research interests focused on the field of public finance, with an expertise in taxation. Lutz was especially concerned with applying research to improve the quality of government financial practices, while also advocating for limits to the scope of government activities and for reductions in government spending. By 1938, he began warning that the government's policy of deficit financing would lead to uncontrolled inflation. He also recommended lower income taxes and a greater use of excise taxation in the form of a flat-rate purchase tax, and fought against price controls. His books include The State Tax Commission (1918), the textbook Public Finance (1924), Guideposts to a Free Economy (1945), A Tax Program for a Solvent America (1945), and A Platform for the American Way (1952).\n\n Lutz served as a tax consultant to various government bodies throughout his career. He was economic advisor to the Ohio Joint Taxation Committee in 1919 and special advisor to the Washington Investigating Committee in 1922. Lutz then served as the revenue expert for financial advisory commissions led by Kemmerer to Chile in 1925 and to Poland in 1926. Lutz was an advisor to the Tax Investigation Commission of Utah in 1929 and the Director of the New Jersey Tax Survey Commission from 1930 to 1931. He was appointed to serve as a financial consultant to the United States Education Commission in 1931 for a four year survey of school finances. In 1935, he became a member of the executive committee of the Princeton Local Government Survey, which engaged in a state-wide survey of taxation by local governments. Lutz also served as director of New York's Temporary Economy Commission from 1942 to 1943, as chief economist for The Tax Foundation in 1944, and as chief of staff of the Committee on Postwar Tax Policy from 1944 to 1947.\n\n Lutz was a member of the American Economic Association, the National Tax Association, of which he was president in 1927 and 1928, and the Academia de Scienca Economica in Chile. He received an honorary degree from Oberlin College in 1932 and was made a Commander in the Order of Polonia Restituta. Lutz retired from Princeton University in 1947, becoming Professor of Public Finance, Emeritus. Following his retirement, Lutz served as a consultant to the National Association of Manufacturers from 1947 to 1962.

He grew up and lived in Topeka, Kansas before attending the California Institute of Technology from 1917-1919. In the 1920-1921 academic year, Rankin studied at the Federal Polytechnic Institute in Zurich. He received his degree in civil engineering from Princeton University in 1922.\n\n His studies were interrupted by active duty in the U.S. Navy during World War I. Following his Princeton graduation, Rankin became a field engineer in Turkey and supervised construction for Near East Relief in the U.S.S.R. (Caucasus region) between 1922 and 1925. After this, he returned to the United States to run a New Jersey real estate company. This career was short-lived, however, and, in 1927, he enlisted in the Foreign Commerce Service. He served in Prague (1929), Athens (1932), Tirana (1932), Albania, and Brussels (1939). By 1940, he achieved the rank of consul while serving in Belgrade. In 1941, he was interned by the Japanese in Manila while en route to an assignment in Egypt. He held subsequent assignments in Athens (1944-1945, 1947-1949) and Belgrade (1945-1946), Vienna (1946-1947), Canton (1949), Hong Kong (1949), and Taipei (1950-1953). He was an ambassador to China from 1953-1957 and to Yugoslavia from 1958-1961. He officially retired in 1961, and in 1964, he wrote a book, China Assignment which discusses his years in Taiwan.\n\n Rankin's first wife, Pauline Jordan (they were married in 1925) died in 1976.
